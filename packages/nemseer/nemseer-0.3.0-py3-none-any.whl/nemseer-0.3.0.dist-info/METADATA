A package for downloading and handling forecasts for the National Electricity Market (NEM) from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO).

## Work in Progress

This package is a work in progress. For a high-level overview of development, check out the [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md).

## Installation

```bash
pip install nemseer
```

## Overview

`nemseer` allows you to access AEMO [pre-dispatch](https://aemo.com.au/en/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/data-nem/market-management-system-mms-data/pre-dispatch) and [Projected Assessment of System Adequacy (PASA)](https://wa.aemo.com.au/energy-systems/electricity/national-electricity-market-nem/nem-forecasting-and-planning/forecasting-and-reliability/projected-assessment-of-system-adequacy) forecast data.

Specifically, `nemseer` enables you to download:

1. 5-minute pre-dispatch (`P5MIN`: [Tables and Descriptions](https://nemweb.com.au/Reports/Current/MMSDataModelReport/Electricity/MMS%20Data%20Model%20Report_files/MMS_222.htm#1))

3. Pre-dispatch Projected Assessment of System Adequacy (`PDPASA`: [Tables and Descriptions](https://nemweb.com.au/Reports/Current/MMSDataModelReport/Electricity/MMS%20Data%20Model%20Report_files/MMS_467.htm#1))
4. [Short Term Projected Assessment of System Adequacy](https://wa.aemo.com.au/-/media/files/electricity/nem/planning_and_forecasting/pasa/stpasa-process-description.pdf) (`STPASA`: [Tables and Descriptions](https://nemweb.com.au/Reports/Current/MMSDataModelReport/Electricity/MMS%20Data%20Model%20Report_files/MMS_335.htm#1))
5. [Medium Term Projected Assessment of System Adequacy](https://wa.aemo.com.au/-/media/files/electricity/nem/planning_and_forecasting/pasa/mt-pasa-process-description-v62.pdf?la=en) (`MTPASA`: [Tables and Descriptions](https://nemweb.com.au/Reports/Current/MMSDataModelReport/Electricity/MMS%20Data%20Model%20Report_files/MMS_210.htm#1))

Another helpful reference for PASA information is AEMO's [Reliability Standard Implementation Guidelines](https://www.aemo.com.au/-/media/files/electricity/nem/planning_and_forecasting/rsig/reliability-standard-implementation-guidelines.pdf?la=en).

### ST PASA Replacement Project

Note that the methodologies for PD PASA and ST PASA are being reviewed. In particular, the ST PASA Replacement project will combine PD PASA and ST PASA into ST PASA. For more detail, refer to the [final determination of the rule change](https://www.aemc.gov.au/sites/default/files/2022-05/ERC0332%20-%20Updating%20Short%20Term%20PASA%20-%20Final%20determination.pdf) and the [AEMO ST PASA Replacement Project home page](https://aemo.com.au/en/initiatives/trials-and-initiatives/st-pasa-replacement-project).
