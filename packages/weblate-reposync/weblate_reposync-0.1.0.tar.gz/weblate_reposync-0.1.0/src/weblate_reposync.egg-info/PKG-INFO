# weblate_reposync

Create [Weblate](https://weblate.org) translation components based on repository content. There is
a [Component discovery](https://docs.weblate.org/no/latest/admin/addons.html#component-discovery) addon
in Weblate, which already does a similar thing, however weblate_reposync is a bit more configurable.

## Installation

`$ pip install weblate_reposync`

## Usage

`$ weblate_reposync -c path_to_conf.cfg`

## Configuration

TODO: To be documented.
