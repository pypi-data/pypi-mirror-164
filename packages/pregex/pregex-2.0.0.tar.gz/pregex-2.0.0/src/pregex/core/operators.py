__doc__ = """
This module contains two classes, namely :class:`Concat` and :class:`Either`, the 
former of which is used to concatenate two or more patterns, whereas the latter
constitutes the alternation operator, which is used whenever either one of the
provided patterns can be matched.

Classes & methods

Below are listed all classes within :py:mod:`pregex.core.operators`
along with any possible methods they may possess.
