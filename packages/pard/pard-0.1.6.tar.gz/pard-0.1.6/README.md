### Overview
Amino acid replacements (also referred to as substitutions) are changes from one amino acid to a different one in a
protein - and there are different ways to assess the difference between the two amino acids that come into play in an
amino acid replacement.

One can look at one or several properties' discrepancy between two amino acids.
To list only a few: polarity

molecular volume / relative sizes of amino-acid side chains

mean number of lone pair electrons on the side-chain

or at the β―γ bond [[2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022519366901123)
or at the γ―δ bond [[2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022519366901123), 
presence of a pyrrolidine ring (proline (P))
[[2]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0022519366901123), 
experimental protein activity and stability after exchanging one amino acid into another

etc.

`pard` is a package designed to make those **P**hysicochemical **A**mino acid **R**eplacement **D**istances calculations
straightforward with Python.

One typical use is to establish a 'distance' between a wild-type protein and its mutated version.


### Getting started
#### Install from PyPI (recommended)
To use `pard`, run `pip install pard` in your terminal.

#### Usage
```py
import pard

amino_acid_1: str = "W"  # Tryptophan
amino_acid_2: str = "L"  # Leucine
distance_grantham: int = pard.grantham.grantham(amino_acid_1, amino_acid_2)
distance_sneath: int   = pard.sneath.sneath(amino_acid_1, amino_acid_2)

print(distance_grantham)
print(distance_sneath)
```
or equivalently
```py
from pard.grantham import grantham
from pard.sneath import sneath

amino_acid_1: str = "W"  # Tryptophan
amino_acid_2: str = "L"  # Leucine
distance_grantham: int = grantham(amino_acid_1, amino_acid_2)
distance_sneath: int   = sneath(amino_acid_1, amino_acid_2)

print(distance_grantham)
print(distance_sneath)
```
will output:
```
>>> 61
>>> 30
```
which are the correct values
