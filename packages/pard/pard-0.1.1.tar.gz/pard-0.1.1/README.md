## PARD (Physicochemical Amino acid Replacement Distances)


### Overview
Amino acid replacements (also referred to as substitutions) are changes from one amino acid to a different one in a
protein - and there are different ways to assess the difference between the two amino acids that come into play in an
amino acid replacement.
One can look at one or several properties' discrepancy between two amino acids. To list only a few: polarity [1][3][4],
molecular volume / relative sizes of amino-acid side chains [1][3][4], mean number of lone pair electrons on the 
side-chain [2], maximum moment of inertia for rotation at the α―β bond [2] or at the β―γ bond [2] or at the γ―δ
bond [2], presence of a pyrrolidine ring (proline (P)) [2], experimental protein activity and stability after 
exchanging one amino acid into another [5], etc.).
