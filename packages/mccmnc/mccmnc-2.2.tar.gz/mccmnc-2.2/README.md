# mcc-mnc

A Mobile Country Code (MCC) is used in cellular networks (GSM, CDMA, UMTS, etc.) to determine the country in which a
mobile subscriber belongs to. To identify a mobile subscriber's network provider, the MCC is combined with a Mobile
Network Code (MNC). The combination of MCC and MNC is called the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) and is the
concatenation of both strings (e.g. MCC of 262 and MNC of 01 results in a PLMN of 26201). Combining the PLMN with the
Mobile Subscription Identification Number (MSIN) results in the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), from
which a mobile subscriber can be uniquely identified.
