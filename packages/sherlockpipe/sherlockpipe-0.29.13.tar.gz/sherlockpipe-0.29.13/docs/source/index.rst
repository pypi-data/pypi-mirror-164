The SHERLOCK (Searching for Hints of Exoplanets fRom Lightcurves Of spaCe-based seeKers) PIPEline is a user-friendly pipeline, which
minimizes the interaction of the user to the minimum when using data coming from *Kepler* or *TESS* missions. **SHERLOCK** makes use of previous well-known and well-tested codes which allow the exoplanets community to explore the public data from space-based missions without need of a deep knowledge of how the data are built and stored.
In most of cases the user only needs to provide with a ``KIC-ID``, ``EPIC-ID``, ``TIC-ID`` or coordinates of the host star where wants to search for exoplanets.
