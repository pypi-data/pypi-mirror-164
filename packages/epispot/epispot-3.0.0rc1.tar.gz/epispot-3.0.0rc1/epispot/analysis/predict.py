"""
The `epispot.analysis.predict` module contains various forecasting tools.
These functions usually take a model and data as inputs and then optimize the model parameters to predict future values.

.. important::
    Forecasts are not always accurate; they are intended for generating *estimations*,
    not exact values, and should be treated as such.

.. warning::
    This particular module is still in beta!
    Most of the functions are not yet implemented.
