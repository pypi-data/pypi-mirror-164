Follow\n:code:`@NorthernLightsForecastBot` on telegram for updates on the Tromsø magnetometer, or\nset up your own telegram bot with this project. Setting up a telegram bot is easy as pie,\njust follow `this guide`_.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nThe project uses `tesseract` to read the scale off a magnetogram plot. See installation\ninstructions below.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. You can install *Northern Lights Forecast* via pip_ from PyPI_:\n\n.. .. code:: console\n\n..    $ pip install northern-lights-forecast\n\nClone the repository:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n    git clone https://github.com/engeir/northern-lights-forecast.git nlf && cd nlf\n\nInstall tesseract_, used with the package pytesseract.\n\nThen get yourself a telegram bot using `this guide`_.\n\nSet up a virtual environment and activate. (Use whatever, for example poetry:\n:code:`poetry shell`.)\n\nNow we are ready to install the project; run :code:`poetry install` in the root of the\nproject.\n\n.. :code:`pillow` is a bit picky, and might have to be installed directly with\n.. pip: :code:`pip install pillow`. And :code:`pip install scipy`, :code:`pip install\n.. scikit-image`, :code:`pip install opencv-python`.\n\nSet up a cron job:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n   sh crontab.sh\n\nRunning :code:`sh croptab.sh -p` will print to the console instead of installing a new\ncron job. It is important to get the correct path to the python virtual environment,\ntherefore, the shell script must be run when the virtual environment is activated. To be\ncertain everything is set up correctly you may want to run :code:`poetry run sh\ncroptab.sh`.\n\nThe cron script will try to start the bot daemon every 10 minutes. The PID for the process\nis saved to :code:`$HOME/.local/share/nlf/nlf-bot.pid`. To stop the bot daemon, run\n\n.. code:: console\n\n    nlfd --stop\n\nThe daemon can also be started manually with\n\n.. code:: console\n\n    nlfd\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nPlease see the `Command-line Reference <Usage_>`_ for details. Below is the output of\n:code:`nlf --help`:\n\n.. code:: console\n\n    Usage: nlf [OPTIONS]\n\n      Northern Lights Forecast.\n\n    Options:\n      --version                     Show the version and exit.\n      -l, --location TEXT           Which magnetometer to use. Run with '--\n                                    locations' option to list all available\n                                    locations.  [default: Tromsø]\n\n      --locations / --no-locations  List out available magnetometer locations.\n                                    [default: False]\n\n      --test / --no-test            Test sending message to telegram.  [default:\n                                    False]\n\n      --help                        Show this message and exit.\n\nTelegram\n^^^^^^^^\n\nIt is also possible to visit the telegram bot (:code:`@NorthernLightsForecastBot`) and\nquery for forecasts live. This includes the commands:\n\n* :code:`/start` and :code:`/help`: this will do the same thing, greet you with a helpful\n  message\n* :code:`/version`: which will print out the version of the project\n* :code:`/locations`: which will print out the valid locations a forecast can be obtained\n  from\n* :code:`Forecast <location>`: that is, any message that starts with the word\n  :code:`forecast` and has a valid location as any of the succeeding words.\n\n.. image:: assets/telegram_screendump.gif\n\nHow?\n----\n\nThe script implements an automated Northern Lights forecast by taking advantage of the web\nsite of `Tromsø Geophysical Observatory`_ (TGO).\n\nImage analysis\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe script will try to download a :code:`.gif` file with plots of the components of a\nmagnetometer. One component is all that is needed (blue line) and the script will then\nlocate the blue pixels and fit a graph to the pixel locations with a `Savitzky-Golay\nfilter`_.\n\nBelow is an example with the original image above the new reverse engineered graph.\n\n.. image:: assets/before.jpg\n\n.. image:: assets/after.png\n\nAt a given threshold of the derivative of the X component of a magnetometer in Tromsø (or\none of the supported locations, see :code:`nlf --locations`), a notification is sent to a\ntelegram bot to let the user know of the current substorm event.\n\nCron\n----\n\nThe script can be run every hour from 18:00 through 08:00 during the months September\nthrough March, using cron to automate the task. Run\n\n.. code:: console\n\n    sh crontab.sh\n\nto set this up, or edit the cron script manually with\n\n.. code:: console\n\n    env EDITOR=nano crontab -e\n\nThe general form of how you edit cron is as shown below, but to get the exact string you\ncan run :code:`sh crontab.sh -p`, where the option :code:`-p` will make the script print\nto the console rather than edit cron. The same options can be used when running the script\nas a cron job as is specified in the `Command-line Reference <Usage_>`_ (e.g.\\ the\n:code:`-l` option).\n\n.. code:: console\n\n    0 0-8,18-23 * 9-12,1-3 * export DISPLAY=:0 && cd /path/to/folder/containing/script && python src/northern_lights_forecast/__main__.py > t.txt 2>&1\n\nTo change when the script is run, edit the cron scheduling to a custom setting:\nhttps://crontab.guru/\n\nThe :code:`crontab.sh` script will try to find the tesseract executable and add this to\npath, which is needed for the cronjob to work.  If it cannot find tesseract, a comment is\ninstead printed warning about this, and you have to verify the installation of tesseract\nand possibly add it to path manually.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nContributions are very welcome.\nTo learn more, see the `Contributor Guide`_.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nDistributed under the terms of the `MIT license`_,\n*Northern Lights Forecast* is free and open source software.\n\n\nIssues\n------\n\nIf you encounter any problems,\nplease `file an issue`_ along with a detailed description.\n\n\nCredits\n-------\n\nThis project was generated from `@cjolowicz`_'s `Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter`_ template.\n\n.. _@cjolowicz: https://github.com/cjolowicz\n.. _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter\n.. _MIT license: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\n.. _PyPI: https://pypi.org/\n.. _Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter: https://github.com/cjolowicz/cookiecutter-hypermodern-python\n.. _file an issue: https://github.com/engeir/northern-lights-forecast/issues\n.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io/\n.. _tesseract: https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Compiling-%E2%80%93-GitInstallation.html\n.. _RealPython: https://realpython.com/python-send-email/#option-1-setting-up-a-gmail-account-for-development\n.. _Tromsø Geophysical Observatory: https://www.tgo.uit.no/\n.. _this guide: https://medium.com/@robertbracco1/how-to-write-a-telegram-bot-to-send-messages-with-python-bcdf45d0a580\n.. _this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdBTLOx0gi4\n.. _Savitzky-Golay filter: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.savgol_filter.html\n.. github-only\n.. _Contributor Guide: CONTRIBUTING.rst\n.. _Usage: https://northern-lights-forecast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html\n",
