        AeMCMC is a Python library that automates the construction of samplers for `Aesara <https://github.com/pymc-devs/aesara>`_ graphs that represent statistical models.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        This project is currently in an alpha state, but the basic features/objectives are currently as follows:
        
        - Provide utilities that simplify the process of constructing Aesara graphs/functions for posterior and posterior predictive sampling
        - Host a wide array of "exact" posterior sampling steps (e.g. Gibbs steps, scale-mixture/decomposition-based conditional samplers, etc.)
        - Build a framework for identifying and composing said sampler steps and enumerating the possible samplers for an arbitrary model
        
        Overall, we would like this project to serve as a hub for community-sourced specialized samplers and facilitate their general use.

        Installation
        ============
        
        The latest release of AeMCMC can be installed from PyPI using ``pip``:
        
        ::
        
            pip install aemcmc
        
        
        Or via conda-forge:
        
        ::
        
            conda install -c conda-forge aemcmc
        
        
        The current development branch of AeMCMC can be installed from GitHub, also using ``pip``:
        
        ::
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/aesara-devs/aemcmc
