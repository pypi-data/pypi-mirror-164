# TransitSpectroscopy ü™ê --- a package for all your transit spectroscopy needs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`transitspectroscopy` is a package containing algorithms and wrappers useful for performing transit (transmission and emission) spectroscopy of exoplanetary systems.

**Author**: Nestor Espinoza (nespinoza@stsci.edu)

## Statement of need
I might fill this in later, but basically: I needed a package to make available all the tools useful for transit spectroscopy: from tracing, spectral extraction to actual lightcurve fitting of wavelength-dependant transits.

## Installation
Installation is as simple as:

        python setup.py install

Or via PyPi:

        pip install transitspectroscopy

Note you need to have the [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) installed for these scripts to successfully install `transitspectroscopy` on your machine. In MacOS, installing the GSL library is as easy as doing `brew install gsl`.
