`xmipy` is an extension to [bmipy](https://pypi.org/project/bmipy/) including an implementation of the abstract methods.
The extended interface is required to couple certain hydrological kernels, particularly MODFLOW 6. Currently it is a joint development of the USGS and Deltares. The [imod_coupler](https://github.com/Deltares/imod_coupler) uses it, for example, to couple Modflow 6 and MetaSWAP.

`xmipy` can be installed by running
```
pip install xmipy
```
