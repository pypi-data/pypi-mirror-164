"""
A container for the expected responses of an operation.
The container maps a HTTP response code to the expected response.

The documentation is not necessarily expected to cover all possible HTTP response codes
because they may not be known in advance.
However, documentation is expected to cover a successful operation response and any known errors.

The `default` MAY be used as a default response object for all HTTP codes
that are not covered individually by the specification.

The `Responses Object` MUST contain at least one response code, and it
SHOULD be the response for a successful operation call.

Fixed Fields

default: Optional[Union[Response, Reference]]

The documentation of responses other than the ones declared for specific HTTP response codes.
Use this field to cover undeclared responses.

Patterned Fields
{httpStatusCode]: Optional[Union[Response, Reference]]

Any [HTTP status code](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#httpCodes) can be used as the property name,
but only one property per code, to describe the expected response for that HTTP status code.
