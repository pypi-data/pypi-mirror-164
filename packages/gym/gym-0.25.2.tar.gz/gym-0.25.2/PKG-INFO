## Gym

Gym is an open source Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing a standard API to communicate between learning algorithms and environments, as well as a standard set of environments compliant with that API. Since its release, Gym's API has become the field standard for doing this.

Gym documentation website is at [https://www.gymlibrary.ml/](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/), and you can propose fixes and changes to it [here](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/gym-docs).

Gym also has a discord server for development purposes that you can join here: https://discord.gg/nHg2JRN489
