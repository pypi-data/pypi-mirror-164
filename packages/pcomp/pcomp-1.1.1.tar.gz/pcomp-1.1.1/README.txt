A simple library that calculates all possible permutations (with repetition) from an iterator and a length.

Example(hex to binnary)

import pcomp

print (pcomp.area(range(2),4)

#it returns: 16

print (pcomp.pc(range(2),4)

#it returns: [[0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1], [0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 1], [0, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0], [1, 1, 1, 1]]

#[0]=0,[1]=1 .... [15]=f

faq:
1. What is the purpose of this package?
-This package was created for educational purposes in my spare time. The algorithm logic was builded by me and probably has no math base, so don't use it on a heavy project because it might not be efficient.

2. Will you be updating this package in the future?
-Of course, I will update this package when I see something I don't like in the code, etc. and when i will be more better in programming or i will just delete it lol.
