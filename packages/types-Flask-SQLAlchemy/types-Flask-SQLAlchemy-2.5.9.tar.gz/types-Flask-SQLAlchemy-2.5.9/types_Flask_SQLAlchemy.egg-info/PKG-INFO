## Typing stubs for Flask-SQLAlchemy

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `Flask-SQLAlchemy` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `Flask-SQLAlchemy`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/Flask-SQLAlchemy. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `cb154816333671ae0b438001b04d298ff3d4559d`.
