        ## Installation
        
        ### User
        
        To install the [latest version of the iDEA code](https://pypi.org/project/iDEA-latest/):
        
        `pip install iDEA-latest`
        
        To add iDEA to your poetry environment:
        
        `poetry add iDEA-latest`
        
        ### Developer
        
        If you would like to develop iDEA, first fork this git repository, and then clone from there.
        
        Add the upstream repository: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/iDEA-org/iDEA.git`
        
        And then install locally: `python setup.py install`
        
        ## Documentation
        
        For full details of usage please see our [tutorial](https://github.com/iDEA-org/iDEA/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb). The full API documentation is available at [readthedocs](https://idea-interacting-dynamic-electrons-approach.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
        
        ## Features
        
        Some of iDEA's features:
        - Exact solution of the many-electron problem by solving the static and time-dependent Schrödinger equation, including exact exchange and correlation.
        - Exact solutions which approach the degree of exchange and correlation in realistic systems.
        - Free choice of external potential that may be time-dependent, on an arbitrarilty dense spatial grid, for any number of electron with any spin configuration.
        - Implementation of various approximate methods (established and novel) for comparison, including:
            - Non-interacting electrons
            - Hartree theory
            - Restricted and unrestricted Hartree-Fock
            - The Local Density Approximation (LDA)
            - Hybrid functionals
        - Implementation of all common observables.
        - Reverse-engineering to solve potential inversion, from exact Kohn-Sham DFT and beyond.
        - Fully parallelised using OpenBLAS.
        - Fully parallelised for all cuda supporting GPUS.
        
        ## Example
        
        In order to solve the Schrödinger equation for the two electron atom for the ground-state charge density and total energy:
        
        ```
        import iDEA
        system = iDEA.system.systems.atom
        ground_state = iDEA.methods.interacting.solve(system, k=0)
        n = iDEA.observables.density(system, state=ground_state)
        E = ground_state.energy
        
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        print(E)
        plt.plot(system.x, n, 'k-')
        plt.show()
        ```
        
        ## Tutorial
        
        We provide a [tutorial](https://github.com/iDEA-org/iDEA/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb) where you can learn how to use the iDEA code in your research and teaching projects.
        
        ## Papers You Can Reproduce With iDEA
        
        1. Advantageous nearsightedness of many-body perturbation theory contrasted with Kohn-Sham density functional theory.
            [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.99.045129), [reprint](https://jackwetherell.github.io/files/nearsightedness.pdf), [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02661.pdf), [code](https://github.com/JackWetherell/advantageous-nearsightedness).
        
        More coming soon...
        
        The development and applications of the iDEA code from 2010 to 2021 is documented [here](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~rwg3/idea.html).
        
        ## Teaching
        
        iDEA can also be used to create teaching content, visualisations and expositions> For example, see the following [YouTube video created using iDEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaSVguMFA-M&ab_channel=JackWetherell).
        
        iDEA was used to create teaching content for the [Density Functional Theory MOOC on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/density-functional-theory).
