# Spatial Networks

## Introduction

### version 0.0.9

This library is a short library that allows you to manipulate Spatial Networks (or Spatial Graphs).
It relies heavily on [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) and [Shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html).

Spatial Graphs are used to simulate real physical networks: nodes are located in space. This allows for interesting studies on the difference between flying distance and routing distance (hopping from one node to another).

It is particularly interesting to simulate city streets or transportation networks.

> It is my first Python library which means I am very proud of it. Yet, this also means that it could be improved. The documentation is far from complete (even far from really started).  If you want to access the source code, it is available on [Github](https://github.com/pauldechorgnat/spatial-networks).

## Documentation

I have tried to document a lot of the functions through DocStrings. Some are still missing but I will be adding them along the way. I will also add a proper documentation (once I figured how Sphinx works).

Until then, I have created some Jupyter notebooks that are showcasing some of the objects and functions of my library. I think they are a good first step.

## Contact

If you have any question, do not hesitate to contact me through Github or by e-mail. I'll be glad to know that I am not the only one interested in my work ! ;)
