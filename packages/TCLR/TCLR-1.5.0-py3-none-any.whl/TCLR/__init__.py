"""
The entire feature space is divided into disjointed unit intervals by hyperplanes parallel to the coordinate axes.
In each partition, TCLR models target y as the function of a feature
TCLR choses the features and split-point to attain the best fit and recursive binary partitions the space,
until some stopping rules are applied.
