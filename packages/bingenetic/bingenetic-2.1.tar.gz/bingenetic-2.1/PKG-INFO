        - #### Binary Code to Genetic Code:
        
        ```python
        import bingenetic
        genetic_code = bingenetic.btg(["00011011"],"dna") # first parameter is binary code as a list, second parameter is the type of genetic code i.e. DNA, or RNA
        ```
        
        - #### Genetic Code to Binary Code:
        
        ```python
        import bingenetic
        binary_code = bingenetic.gtb(["ACGT"],"dna") # first parameter is genetic code as a list, second parameter is the type of genetic code i.e. DNA, or RNA
        ```
        
        
        #### Installation using pip:
        ```
        pip install bingenetic
        ```
        
        ```
