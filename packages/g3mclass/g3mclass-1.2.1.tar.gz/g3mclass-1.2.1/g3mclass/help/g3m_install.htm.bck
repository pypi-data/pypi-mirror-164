<h1><font color="#3465a4"><code>g3mclass</code> installation</font></h1>
<h2><font color="#3465a4">Requirements</font></h2>
<p><code>g3mclass</code> is multi-platform (MacOS, Linux, Windows, ...) software. Depending on your platform it can be installed by different methods. The most universal one is using <code>pip</code> utility distributed with Python3 <a href="https://www.python.org/" class="uri">https://www.python.org/</a>. So the first requirement is to have a recent Python3 installed. Its executable must be in your PATH variable, i.e. if you open a shell (CMD or PowerShell on Windows) and type <code>python</code>, this command should not end-up in an error message.</p>

<h2><font color="#3465a4">Installation with <code>pip</code></font></h2>
<p>This is a universal installation method which is supposed to work on all platforms where Python3 is available but requires using a command line interface (signaled by <code>$</code> at the beginning of a line) both for installation and for launching <code>g3mclass</code> after installation. The installation itself is quite simple:</p>
<p><code>$ python3 -m pip install --user -U g3mclass</code></p>
<p>This command will download and install the latest version of <code>g3mclass</code> as well as all necessary dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>wxpython</li>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
<li>xlsxwriter</li>
</ul>
<p>After a successful installation, the software can be launched with:</p>
<p><code>$ g3mclass</code></p>
<p>If this command fails, it can be because of the installation directory is not in your PATH variable. Probably, you've got a warning about this fact during installation step. To remedy, add the signaled directory to PATH and restart shell and <code>g3mclass</code>.</p>
<p>To uninstall the software, run:</p>
<p><code>$ python3 -m pip uninstall g3mclass</code></p>

<h2><font color="#3465a4">Automatic installation on MacOS</font></h2>
<p>We have prepared a disk image <a href="https://mathscell.github.io/download/g3mclass/macos/install.dmg">dmg</a> that you can download. Once opened, you will find two scripts on it: <code>install</code> and <code>uninstall</code>. Right click on <code>install</code> and chose <code>Open</code> from contextual menu. Confirm that you agree to execute this script provided by a unidentified (by Apple Co.) developer. The script will do nothing else than installation that was described in previous section but an advantage of this method is that a user does not have to manipulate shell windows. It will be opened automatically and a user will be able to survey installation process. This shell window can be safely closed after the installation.</p>
<p>Another advantage of this method is that an icon will be created on user's desktop pointing to <code>g3mclass</code>. So that its launching can simply be done by a right-click/Open on this icon and confirming that this program can be executed. Thus a user does not have to open a shell window neither type any command to get <code>g3mclass</code> running.</p>
<p>To uninstall <code>g3mclass</code> software, simply right-click on <code>unisntall</code> on dmg disk, choose <code>Open</code> from contextual menu and confirm that you want to execute this script.</p>

<h2><font color="#3465a4">Automatic installation on Windows</font></h2>
<p>We have prepared <a href="https://mathscell.github.io/download/g3mclass/win/install.bat"><code>install.bat</code></a> and <a href="https://mathscell.github.io/download/g3mclass/win/uninstall.bat"><code>unistall.bat</code></a> that must be downloaded on user's disk and executed with administrative privileges. If your Python is coming from <a href="https://anaconda.org">Anaconda</a> distribution than these scripts should be run from a shell where <code>conda</code> is activated. Otherwise <code>python</code> executable won't be found.</p>
