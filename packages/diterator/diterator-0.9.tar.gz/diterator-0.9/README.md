Iterator through IATI activities from D-Portal
==============================================

This library makes it easy to download [IATI](https://iatistandard.org) activities from [D-Portal](https://d-portal.org) and iterate through them. It takes care of issues like paging, XML parsing, etc. There are wrapper classes for the most-common properties of an [IATI activity](https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/), and the entire XML is available through [XPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath) queries (if desired).

## Usage

The _diterator.iterator.Iterator_ class (also available from the package root) creates a stream of IATI activities from D-Portal matching the query parameters you provide:

```
from diterator import Iterator

activities = Iterator({
    "country_code": "ye",
})

for activity in activities:
    print("Activity", activity.identifier)
```

By default, the Iterator class filters duplicate activities out of the results. If you don't want that behaviour, add the parameter ``deduplicate=False``

Each activity appears inside a [wrapper](#activity-object) that gives you easy access to the most-common properties (see documentation below). You can also use [XPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath) queries to pull out specific pieces of information.

### D-Portal query parameters

Full documentation of the D-Portal query parameters is available here:

https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/blob/master/documents/dstore_q.md

The most common D-Portal query parameters include the following:

Parameter | Description | Example
-- | -- | --
reporting | The reporting org name | World Health Organization
reporting_code | The reporting org IATI code | XM-DAC-928
aid | IATI identifier for a specific activity | XM-DAC-928-ER-2016-17-02.006.AF01.ERI01
sector_code | A specific OECD-DAC sector code | 72050
title | The activity title in English. | Technical assistance to enable (...)
description | The activity description in English. | This activity will (...)
country_code | The [ISO 3166:1-alpha2 code](https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/country/) for a recipient country. | SO
location_name | A name of a specific location (as specified by the publisher). | Tombali
day_start | The activity's start date | 2020-01-01
day_end | The activity's end date | 2020-12-31
status_code | The activity's [status code](https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/activitystatus/) | 2

Use "|" to separate multiple values, and append "\_nteq" to the property name for "not equal", "\_gt" for "greater than", "\_gteq" for "greater than or equal", "\_lt" for "less than", "\_lteq" for less than or equal, "\_glob" for case-sensitive string matching with "*" and "\_" as wildcards, or "\_like" for case-insensitive string matching.

For example, if you wanted to find all activities for Somalia or Kenya in 2020, you could pass this query to the iterator:

```
from diterator import Iterator

activities = Iterator({
    "country_code": "SO|KE",
    "day_end_gteq": "2020-01-01",
    "day_start_lteq": "2020-12-31",
})
```

If you wanted to further filter to only activities with a DAC sector code starting with "7", you could use

```
activities = Iterator({
    "country_code": "SO|KE",
    "day_end_gteq": "2020-01-01",
    "day_start_lteq": "2020-12-31",
    "sector_code_glob": "7????",
})
```

Again, go to the [D-Portal Q API documentation](https://github.com/devinit/D-Portal/blob/master/documents/dstore_q.md) for full details.

### Using an XML file or URL instead of the D-Portal Q API

If you prefer to read IATI activities directly from a URL (e.g. one found at the [IATI Registry](https://iatiregistry.org/)) or a local file, then you can use the XMLIterator class instead:

```
from diterator import XMLIterator

activities = XMLIterator(url="https://static.rijksoverheid.nl/bz/IATIACTIVITIES20202021.xml")
for activity in activities:
    print(activity.identifier)
```

If your source is a URL rather than a file object or local file name, as in the example above, then you need to put "url=" before it. For a local XML file, leave the "url=" out, so the above example would look like this:

```
from diterator import XMLIterator

activities = diterator.XMLIterator("IATIACTIVITIES20202021.xml")
for activity in activities:
    print(activity.identifier)
```

## Wrapper objects

Each activity will be returned wrapped in the Python class diterator.wrappers.Activity, which provides simple access to many of the common properties. All wrappers support some common properties for direct queries against the XML (in case the information you need isn't covered by the properties):

Method | Description | Example
-- | -- | --
get_text(xpath_expr) | Get the text content of the _first_ [DOM](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.dom.html) node matching the [XPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath) expression. | activity.get_text("reporting-org/@ref")
get_narrative(xpath_expr) | Get the multilingual narrative content inside the first node matching the XPath expression. |  activity.get_narrative("title")
get_organisation(xpath_expr) | Get the organisation info for the first node matching the XPath expression. | transaction.get_organisation("provider-org")
get_node(xpath_expr) | Get the first first DOM node matching the XPath expression. | transaction.get_node("value")
get_nodes(xpath_expr) | Get a list of _all_ the DOM nodes matching the XPath expression. | activity.get_nodes("sector[@vocabulary=10]")
extract_node_text(node) | Extract the text from an element or attribute DOM node.

### Transaction object

Represents a transaction inside an IATI activity. 

The class will return default values from the activity if they are not specified for the transaction. If you want to see if the transaction actually specifies the properties itself, use the get_node or get_text methods. For example, the following will specify whether the _humanitarian_ attribute, sectors, and aid type actually appear on the transaction itself:

```
transaction_humanitarian_flag = transaction.get_text("@humanitarian")
tranaction_has_own_sectors = (len(transaction.get_nodes("sector")) > 0)
transaction_has_own_aid_type = (transaction.get_node("aid-type") is not None)
```

Property | Description | Return value
-- | -- | --
activity | The parent activity. | [Activity](#activity-object)
ref | The transaction reference, if available. | string
humanitarian | "Is humanitarian" flag at the transaction level (ignoring the activity level). | boolean or None if unspecified

currency | ISO 4217 currency code for the transaction (overrides activity default). | string
value_date | Date to use for currency conversion, in ISO 8601 format. | string
description | Descriptive text for the transaction, possibly in multiple languages. | [NarrativeText](#narrativetext-object)
provider_org | The source of the funds in the transaction. | [Organisation](#organisation-object)
receiver_org | The destination of the funds in the transaction. | [Organisation](#organisation-object)
disbursement_channel | A code for the transaction's [disbursment channel](https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/disbursementchannel/). | string
sectors | A list of transaction sectors (all vocabularies), overriding the activity defaults. If the transaction has no sectors, return the activity's sectors as a default. | list of [CodedItem](#codeditem-object)

aid_types_by_vocabulary | A dict of [aid type codes](https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/aidtype/) specified for the transaction, keyed by vocabulary. If the transaction has no aid types, return the activity's default aid types. | list of [CodedItem](#codeditem-object)
tied_status | A code for the transaction's [tied status](https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/tiedstatus/). If the transaction has no tied status, return the activity's default tied status. | string

### NarrativeText object

Represents multilingual text wherever it is allowed in IATI. If the language of a translation is unspecified, it will default to the parent activity's default_language property. If you us this object in a string context, it will return the text in the activity's default language (if available) or the first translation specified, so if you wrap this in str(), use it in a print() function, etc, you'll get a simple string.

Property | Description | Return value
-- | -- | --
activity | The parent activity. | [Activity](#activity-object)
narratives | All available translations, keyed by language. | dict of string

-- | -- | --
activity | The parent activity. | [Activity](#activity-object)
ref | The organisation identifier, if available. | string
type | The organisation's type code. | string
role | The organisation's role code (if relevant). | string
activity_id | The organisation's own IATI identifier for the activity (if relevant). | string
name | All translations of the organisation's name. | [NarrativeText](#narrativetext-object)

### Location object

Wrapper for a specific location associated with an activity.

Property | Description | Return value
-- | -- | --
activity | The parent activity. | [Activity](#activity-object)
ref | The location's code, if available. | string
location_reach | The location's reach code, if available. | string
location_ids | Identifiers provided for the location, all vocabularies. | list of [CodedItem](#codeditem-object)
name | All translations of the location's name. | [NarrativeText](#narrativetext-object)
description | All translations of the location's description. | [NarrativeText](#narrativetext-object)
activity_description | Translations of the description of the activity as it applies in this location. | [NarrativeText](#narrativetext-object)
administratives | Administrative codes for this location. | list of [CodedItem](#codeditem-object)
point | Latitude and longitude, space separated. | string
point_reference_system | Name of the lat/lon reference system used. | string
exactness | Code for the location exactness. | string
location_class | Code for the location class. | string
feature_designation | Code for the location's feature designation. | string

### CodedItem object

This class applies to any item that can have a code and optionally, a vocabulary and/or descriptive text. In a string context (e.g. print() or str()), this object will return its code property. Some properties will always return None, depending on context.

Property | Description | Return value
-- | -- | --
activity | The parent activity. | [Activity](#activity-object)
code | Code for this item. | string
vocabulary | Code for the (relevant) vocabulary in use. | string

### Identifier object

Represents a non-IATI identifier (e.g. iati-activity/other-identifier).

Property | Description | Return value
-- | -- | --
activity | The parent activity. | [Activity](#activity-object)
ref | The alternative identifier. | string
type | The identifier [type code](https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/otheridentifiertype/). | string
owner_org | The organisation that owns the identifier, if specified. | [Organisation](#organisation-object)

## Example

```
# Print the identifier and title of every activity for Somalia from 2019 to 2021

from diterator import Iterator

activities = Iterator({
    "country_code": "so",
    "day_end_gteq": "2019-01-01",
    "day_start_lteq": "2021-12-31",
})

for activity in activities:
    print(activity.identifier, activity.title)
```

You can also get at anything in an activity via the DOM and XPath:

```
transaction_nodes = activity.get_nodes("transaction")

identifier = activity.get_text("iati-identifier")
```

Though normally, to iterate through transactions, you'd just do something like

```
for transaction in activity.transactions:
    print(transaction.type, transaction.date, transaction.currency, transaction.value)
```

There are also helper properties to group sectors, participating organisations, etc

```
for sector in activity.sectors_by_vocabulary.get("10", []):
    print(sector.code, sector.percentage, sector.name)
```
