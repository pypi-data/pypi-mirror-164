Python PlayStation Remote Play API

[Documentation](https://pyremoteplay.readthedocs.io/en/latest)

## About ##
This project provides an API to programmatically connect to and control Remote Play hosts (PS4 and PS5). The low-level networking internals is written using the Asyncio framework. In addition it includes an optional GUI, allowing to view the live stream and control the host through keyboard/mouse input. This library is based on the C/C++ project [Chiaki](https://github.com/thestr4ng3r/chiaki).

## Features ##
- API to programatically control host and expose live audio/video stream
- Registering client for Remote Play on the host 
- Interface for controlling the host, which emulates a DualShock controller
- Ability to power off/on the host if standby is enabled
- GUI which displays the live stream and supports keyboard/mouse input
- Support for controllers

## Requirements ##
- Python 3.8+
- OS: Linux, Windows 10

- Note: Untested on MacOS

## Network Requirements ##
This project will only work with local devices; devices on the same local network.
You may be able to connect with devices on different subnets, but this is not guaranteed.

## GUI Dependencies ##
The GUI requires dependencies that may be complex to install.
Below is a list of such dependencies.
- pyav (May require FFMPEG to be installed)
- PySide6

`uvloop` is supported for the GUI and will be used if installed.

## Installation ##
It is recommended to install in a virtual environment.

```
  python3 -m venv .
  source bin/activate
```

### From pip ###
To install core package run:
```
pip install pyremoteplay
```

To install with optional GUI run:
```
pip install pyremoteplay[gui]
```

### From Source ###
To Install from source, clone this repo and navigate to the top level directory.

```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python setup.py install
```

To Install GUI dependencies run:
```
  pip install -r requirements-gui.txt
```

## Setup ##
There are some steps that must be completed to use this library from a user standpoint.
- Registering a PSN Account
- Linking PSN Account and client to the Remote Play Host

Configuration files are saved in the `.pyremoteplay` folder in the users home directory. Both the CLI and GUI utilize the same files.

### CLI Setup ###
Registering and linking can be completed through the cli by following the prompts after using the below command:

`pyremoteplay {host IP Address} --register`

Replace `{host IP Address}` with the IP Address of the Remote Play host.

### GUI Setup ###
Registering and linking can be performed in the options screen.

## Usage ##
To run the terminal only CLI use the following command:
`pyremoteplay {host IP Address}`

To run the GUI use the following command:
`pyremoteplay-gui`

## Notes ##
- Video decoding is performed by the CPU by default. Hardware Decoding can be enabled in the options screen in the GUI.
- You may have to install `ffmpeg` with hardware decoding enabled and then install `pyav` with the following command to allow for hardware decoding:
`pip install av --no-binary av`


## Baseline measurements ##
The CLI instance runs at 5-10% CPU usage with around 50Mb memory usage according to `top` on this author's machine: ODroid N2.

## Known Issues/To Do ##
- Text sending functions
- Add support for HDR
- Audio stutters
