# hUMILIATION

Humiliate your python interpreter whenever it catches an exception. Remind your computer that it is 
a machine and you are a god


Using the nerdemoji:
```
from nerdemoji import nerdemojirun


def example():
    ex_list = [1, 2, 3]
    print(ex_list[4])


nerdemojirun(example)
```
