# hUMILIATION

Humiliate your python interpreter whenever it catches an exception. Remind your computer that it is 
a machine and you are a god


Using the:
```py
from nerdemoji import nerdemoji


def example():
    ex_list = [1, 2, 3]
    print(ex_list[4])


nerdemoji.nerdemojirun(example)
```

Output:
```
list index out of range
"list index out of range"
-ðŸ¤“
```

my favourite color is `#4EF542`
