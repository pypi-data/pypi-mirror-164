`Forever Scalable`

**Quo** is a toolkit for writing Command-Line Interface(CLI) applications and a TUI (Text User Interface) framework for Python.

Quo is making headway towards composing speedy and orderly CLI and TUI applications while forestalling any disappointments brought about by the failure to execute a python application.
Simple to code, easy to learn, and does not come with needless baggage. 

## Compatibility
Quo works flawlessly  with Linux, OSX, and Windows.
Quo requires Python `3.8` or later. 


## Features
- [x] Support for Ansi, RGB and Hex color models
- [x] Support for tabular presentation of data
- [x] Intuitive progressbars
- [x] Code completions
- [x] Nesting of commands
- [x] Customizable Text User Interface _(TUI)_ dialogs.
- [x] Automatic help page generation
- [x] Syntax highlighting
- [x] Autosuggestions
- [x] Key Binders

## Getting Started
### Installation
You can install quo via the Python Package Index (PyPI)

```
pip install -U quo

```

In order to check your installation you can use
```
python -m pip show quo
```
Run the following to test Quo output on your terminal:
```
python -m quo

```
![test](https://github.com/scalabli/quo/raw/master/docs/images/test.png)

## Quo echo
To output formatted text to your terminal you can import the [echo](https://quo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#quick-start) method.
Try this:

**Example 1**
```python
 from quo import echo

 echo("Hello, World!", fg="red", italic=True, bold=True)
```
![Hello World](https://github.com/scalabli/quo/raw/master/pics/print.png)

**Example 2**
```python
 from quo import echo

 echo("Quo is ", nl=False)
 echo("scalable", bg="red", fg="black") 
```
![Scalable](https://github.com/scalabli/quo/raw/master/pics/scalable.png)

Alternatively, you can import [print](https://quo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/printing_text.html#print)
```python
 from quo import print

 print('<b>This is bold</b>')
 print('<i>This is italic</i>')
 print('<u>This is underlined</u>')
                    
 # Colors from the ANSI palette.
 print('<red>This is red</red>')
 print('<style fg="green" bg="red">Green on red background</stlye>')

```
## Quo prompt
 - Using ``quo.prompt`` method.
```python
 from quo import prompt

 prompt("What is your name?")
```
![quo.prompt](https://github.com/scalabli/quo/raw/master/pics/prompt.png)

- Using ``quo.prompt.Prompt`` object

```python
 from quo.prompt import Prompt
   
 session = Prompt()
 session.prompt("Type something:") 
```
Read more on [Prompt](https://quo.readthedocs.io/latest/prompt.html)

# Quo Library
Quo contains a number of builtin features you can use to create elegant output in your CLI.

Click the following headings for details:»
<details>
<summary>Console</summary>
For more control over quo terminal content, import and construct a `Console` object.

```python
   
  from quo.console import Console

  console = Console()

```

## ``Launching Applications``

Quo supports launching applications through `Console.launch`. This can be used to open the default application associated with a URL or filetype.
```python

 from quo.console import Console
   
 console = Console()
 console.launch("https://quo.rtfd.io/")
                                                    
```
Read more on [Console](https://quo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/console.html)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Completion</summary>

## ``Autocompletion``

Press [Tab] to autocomplete
```python

 from quo.prompt import Prompt
 from quo.completion import WordCompleter
 example = WordCompleter(['USA', 'UK', 'Canada', 'Kenya'])
 session = Prompt(completer=example)
 session.prompt('Which country are you from?: ')
```
![Autocompletion](https://github.com/scalabli/quo/raw/master/docs/images/autocompletion.png)

## ``Autosuggestion``
Auto suggestion is a way to propose some input completions to the user. Usually, the input is compared to the history and when there is another entry starting with the given text, the completion will be shown as gray text behind the current input. Pressing the right arrow → or ctrl-e will insert this suggestion, alt-f willinsert the first word of the suggestion.
```python

 from quo.history import MemoryHistory
 from quo.prompt import Prompt

 MemoryHistory.append("import os")
 MemoryHistory.append('print("hello")') 
 MemoryHistory.append('print("world")')  
 MemoryHistory.append("import path")

 session = Prompt(history=MemoryHistory, suggest="history")

 while True:
    session.prompt('> ')
```
Read more on [Completions](https://quo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prompt.html#completion)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Documenting Scripts</summary>
Quo automatically generates help pages for your command-line tools.

```python
 from quo import print
 from quo.console import command
 from quo.console import app

 @command()
 @app('--count', default=1, help='number of greetings')
 @app('--name', prompt="What is your name?", help="The person to greet")

def hello(count: int, name: str):
    """This script prints hello NAME COUNT times."""
       for x in range(count):
           print(f"Hello {name}!")

 if __name__ == "__main__:
          hello()
```
And what it looks like:

</details>
<details>
<summary>Progress</summary>
Creating a new progress bar can be done by calling the class **ProgressBar**
The progress can be displayed for any iterable. This works by wrapping the iterable (like ``range``) with the class **ProgressBar**

```python

 import time
 from quo.progress import ProgressBar
  
 with ProgressBar() as pb:
               for i in pb(range(800)):
                             time.sleep(.01)
```
![Progress](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scalabli/quo/master/docs/images/simple-progress-bar.png)

Read more on [Progress](https://quo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/progress.html)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Key Binding</summary>
A key binding is an association between a physical key on a keyboard and a parameter.

```python
  
 from quo import echo
 from quo.keys import bind
 from quo.prompt import Prompt
 
 session = Prompt()

 # Print "Hello world" when ctrl-h is pressed
 @bind.add("ctrl-h")
 def _(event):
     echo("Hello, World!")

 session.prompt(">> ")
```
Read more on [Key bindings](https://quo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kb.html)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Dialog</summary>
High level API for displaying dialog boxes to the user for informational purposes, or get input fromthe user.

1) Example of a message box dialog.
```python

 from quo.dialog import MessageBox

 MessageBox(
         title="Message pop up window",
         text="Do you want to continue?\nPress ENTER to quit.")                                    
```
The above produces the following output
![Message Box](https://github.com/scalabli/quo/raw/master/docs/images/messagebox.png)

2) Example of a prompt box dialog
```python
 from quo.dialog import InputBox

 InputBox(
           title="InputBox shenanigans",
           text="What Country are you from?:")

```
![Prompt Box](https://github.com/scalabli/quo/raw/master/docs/images/promptbox.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Table</summary>

Function [Table](https://quo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/table.html) offers a number of configuration options to set the look and feel of the table, including how borders are rendered and the style and alignment of the columns.

Example
```python
 from quo.table import Table

 data = [
   ["Name", "Gender", "Age"],
   ["Alice", "F", 24],
   ["Bob", "M", 19],
   ["Dave", "M", 24]
 ]
 Table(data)
```
![tabulate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scalabli/quo/master/docs/images/table.png)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Widgets</summary>
A collection of reusable components for building full screen applications.

## ``Label``
Widget that displays the given text. It is not editable or focusable.
```python

 from quo import container
 from quo.widget import Label

 content = Label("Hello, World", style="fg:black bg:red")
  
 # Press Ctrl-C to exit
 
 container(content, bind=True, full_screen=True)

```
