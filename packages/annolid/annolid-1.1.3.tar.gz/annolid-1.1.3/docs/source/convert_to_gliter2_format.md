In this video, we'll show you how to convert the instance segmentation results to glitter2 format.

First, start the Annolid GUI and click Glitter2 icon in the toolbar list.


On the opened dialog window, click and open the video file and the tracking results CSV file.

You can choose to open an optional zone info json file which contains all the labeled zones and non-moving objects. 

The default score threshold value is 0.15. You can adjust it based on your need.   


(pause: 10)

Click Ok and wait for the process to finish. 

(pause: 5)

When the conversion is done, it will save a video with masks and a nix format CSV file to your disk.
You can play the video and the nix file for quality checks.
