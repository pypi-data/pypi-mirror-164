In this video, we'll show you how to label zones in a given frame.

First, start the Annolid GUI and load the images by clicking the open dir icon in the toolbar. Click Create polygons in the toolbar list.


On the frame, click and draw a polygon around the selected object in the video frame.

When you return to the start point, you can type the name of the object in the opened dialog.  


(pause: 10)

You can continue the labeling process util all the desired objects and zones are labeled. 

(pause: 5)

When the process is done, you can click `Ctrl + S` or `Save` in the toolbar list to save the zone information to a .json format file e.g. zone_info.json.
