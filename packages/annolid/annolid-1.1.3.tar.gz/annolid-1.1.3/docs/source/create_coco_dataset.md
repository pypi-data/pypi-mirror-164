In this video, we'll show you how to create your COCO format dataset.

First, start the Annolid GUI and click COCO format icon in the toolbar list.


On the opened dialog window, click and open the annotations directory.

Please open the labels text file and type the number of labeled frames for training set. 
If you select a number that is greater than the number of available labeled frames, the program will split 0.7 for training and 0.3 for test.   


(pause: 10)

Click Ok and wait for the process to finish. 

(pause: 5)

When the conversion is done, it will show a message box to you for the location of the COCO dataset on your disk.
You can check and use the dataset for training your instance segmentation models.
