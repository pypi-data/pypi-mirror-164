# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.8 - 2022-08-25](https://gitlab.com/thegalagic/figular/-/releases/v0.0.7)

### Fixed

* We were not logging stderr when encoutering failures in the API.
* Cmdline: return a non-zero return code on errors.

### Added

* We now test the Dockerfile and API by spining up a container. This helps
  detect any misconfigurations in the runtime environment.
* Cmdline and API: for the circle Figure you can now style the 'circle'
  primitive it is drawn with, controlling background-color, border-color etc.
* Website: for the circle Figure there is now a much greater choice of fonts.

### Changed

* More generous limits on Figure data - increased from 1k to 5k characters.
* The cmdline has changed, now we expect args DATA and optional STYLE as a JSON
  doc. Initially we can only style circle but we'll extend this in future. This
  also means our pip install requires pydantic as a dependancy. Circle also no
  longer needs `blob=`. Docs have been updated.
* The API for circle has changed as we move towards a simpler message containing
  just 'data' and 'style' for all figures but starting with circle.
* The API's code now lives in dir `app` instead of `api` which is picked up
  automatically by FastAPI. This means we can deploy the whole package as-is in
  the Dockerfile and gives consistency between dev, testing and production.

## [0.0.7 - 2022-08-17](https://gitlab.com/thegalagic/figular/-/releases/v0.0.7)

### Added

* Now people can host their own Figular website and API like we do on
  figular.com:
  * New [Hugo Module](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/) containing all the web
    layout and JavaScript necessary to host Figures in a Hugo site. Note that we
    depend on the [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) framework.
  * New Dockerfile for hosting the back end API in a container.
  * Full instructions on how to make it all work:
    [SelfHosting](docs/SelfHosting.md)

### Changed

* The configuration parameter `FIGULAR_API_HOST` in the hugo
  module that tells it where the back end is now includes the protocol as well
  as the domain. This allows people to choose whether to use http or https as
  we did not want to include steps for HTTPS setup in the self-hosting doc. So
  if you had this before in your Hugo `config.yaml`:

```yaml
params:
  figular_api_host: localhost:8081
```

  ...you now need to add the protocol like this:

```yaml
params:
  figular_api_host: http://localhost:8081
```

## [0.0.6 - 2022-08-12](https://gitlab.com/thegalagic/figular/-/releases/v0.0.6)

### Changed

* API: set the timeout on the asy process by environment variable so it can be
  controlled by deployment not code.

## [0.0.5 - 2022-08-11](https://gitlab.com/thegalagic/figular/-/releases/v0.0.5)

### Changed

* Big changes underneath, not yet exposed to end users:
  * Use [asyunit v2](https://gitlab.com/thegalagic/asymptote-glg-contrib/-/releases/v2.0.0)
    for tests which gives better isolation and detects more issues.
  * Evolved our libraries that power the figures. Drawing is expressed in more
    natural language and many more parts are stylable.
  * Use `xelatex` engine instead of `latex` as much better font support.
* All dependencies update to latest

### Removed

* Figure 'board election' has been removed to focus on our core figures. This
  decision was taken to avoid extra work in migrating it to the new changes
  above.

## [0.0.4 - 2022-05-13](https://gitlab.com/thegalagic/figular/-/releases/v0.0.4)

### Added

* New figure 'board election' introduced. See
  [docs](docs/figures/case/boardelection.md) and blog post [A new Figure for the
  OSI Board Election](https://figular.com/post/20220511172059/a-new-figure-for-the-osi-board-election/)
  for more info.
* New form at the cmdline `fig [file]` where you can run any custom Asymptote
  file and easily import our figures, e.g. `import "org/orgchart" as orgchart;`
  This allows anyone to combine existing figures into new pictures.
* Use an explicit 'style reset' in all figures so they all start from the same
  assumptions. This is particularly important now we are combining figures in
  board election.

### Changed

* The cmdline interface has changed so we can accept markdown. Now the first
  argument is either a file or figure and the remaining arguments are fed to the
  figure. You also no longer need to prefix a figure name with a hyphen.
* The input for a Figure is now of type `string[]` instead of `file`.
  Asymptote (I have discovered) will implicitly cast a file to string[] for us.
  This makes life much easier for testing and for reusing existing Figures in
  new pictures as we do not need to create files to pass data around.

### Removed

* We no longer rely on Asymptote's default `stdin` global variable which defines
  `#` as the comment char as we now need to interpret markdown. So comments are
  no longer possible in input (for now).

## [0.0.3 - 2022-02-15](https://gitlab.com/thegalagic/figular/-/releases/v0.0.3)

### Added

* New figure `org/orgchart` for organisational charts. See
  [orgchart](docs/figures/org/orgchart.md) in the docs for details.
* All Figure documentation has been expanded to cover website usage.
* README: direct contributors to our new wiki.

### Fixed

* Figures can accept and cope with all ASCII printable characters as input. We
  apply fuzz testing to this.
* Don't set CORS in the app, better set on network applicances.
* Build: clear out old built packages otherwise twine will try and upload them
  and fail.

### Changed

* Dependencies updated to latest.

## [0.0.2 - 2021-11-10](https://gitlab.com/thegalagic/figular/-/releases/v0.0.2)

### Added

* More detail on the deployment instructions.

### Fixed

* Quick patch to increase asy timeout to 3s which was hitting 1s limit on prod

## [0.0.1 - 2021-11-08](https://gitlab.com/thegalagic/figular/-/releases/v0.0.1)

### Added

* New cmdline flag `--help` to show usage.
* An API using FastAPI so Figular can be hosted and accessible over HTTP.
* GOVERNANCE.md was missing, added benevolent dictator.

### Fixed

* Bugs in figure `concept/circle`:
  * Crash when not given any blobs. Now we will skip drawing.
  * Crash when one blob and middle=true
  * Blobs were drawn on top of each other when only two blobs and middle=true

## [0.0.0 - 2020-04-01](https://gitlab.com/thegalagic/figular/-/releases/v0.0.0)

First version, basic cmdline usage and docs.

### Added

* New figure `concept/circle`, see docs for details.
