# sciprs

[scipy](https://scipy.org) but really written in pure Rust. Checkout [sci-rs](https://github.com/qsib-cbie/sci-rs) for Rust implementations behind the Python interface

## Why sciprs instead of scipy

scipy is largely written in Python, Pyrex, C, and Fortran. scipy is great for research and servers. Rust is a cross platform language that provides both performance improvements and portability to scipy.

sciprs acts as the wrapper around a library that is ready to translate directly into embedded, mobile, web, or server deployments without losing the agility of Python's powerful interactive scripting abilities.

## How to use sciprs

Change you scipy import to sciprs. sciprs strives to provide the same functionality as scipy without compromising with a rich history of documentation and published research.

 ```python3
 from scipy.signal import sosfilt, butter
 ```
 becomes
 ```python3
 from sciprs.signal import sosfilt, butter
 ```
 
 ## Installation
 
 Install the package from PyPi like usual, `sciprs`. The GitHub Actions will generate a compiled wheel for most major platforms each release.
 
 ```zsh
 pip3 install sciprs
 ```

### Compilation from source

`maturin` provides the build system hooks with `pyo3` as the intermediate between Python and Rust

```zsh
maturin build
```
