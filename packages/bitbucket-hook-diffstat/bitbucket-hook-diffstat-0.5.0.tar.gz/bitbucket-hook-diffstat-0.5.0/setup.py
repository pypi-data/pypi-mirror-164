It handles some basic retries on unexpected HTTP response codes from BitBucket.\n\n## Usage\n```python\nfrom bitbucket_hook_diffstat import process_bitbucket_push_events\n\nresult = process_bitbucket_push_events(\n    push_payload, repo_owner, repo_name, bitbucket_user, bitbucket_password\n) # it might raise an Exception, please check `bitbucket_hook_diffstat/exceptions.py`\n\nresult # Is a dict of a zero or more branch names - strings to the set of one or many file pathnames - strings.\n{\'master\': {\'.gitignore\'}}\n```\n\n`push_payload` is a Bitbucket repository [push event](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/event-payloads/#Push)\n\n`repo_owner` and `repo_name` one can retrieve from the repository URL `https://bitbucket.org/repo_owner/repo_name` \n\n`bitbucket_password` is an "app password" and `bitbucket_user` is available as "Username" in Bitbucket profile settings. This user should be authorized to do Repositories Read.',
