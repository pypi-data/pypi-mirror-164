# Bitbucket hook diffstat

## Overview

This is a simple webhook handler for Bitbucket repository push events.

It processes branch update and branch create events and extracts the file paths which were changed in that event.
In case of branch update event get's the changset between current HEAD of the branch and the previous HEAD of that branch.
In case if branch is created it get's the changset between current HEAD of the branch and HEAD of main branch of the repository.

## Usage
Set following environment variables:
```

BITBUCKET_REPO_SLUG
BITBUCKET_USER
BITBUCKET_PASSWORD
```
