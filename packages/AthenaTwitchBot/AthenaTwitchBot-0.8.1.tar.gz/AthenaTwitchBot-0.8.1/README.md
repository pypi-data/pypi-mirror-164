## Package Details
#### Details and features 
- A library to connect to the Twitch IRC system for a chatbot to utilize 
- Isn't dependent on 3rd party packages, except for those that have been created by [@AndreasSas](https://github.com/AndreasSas)
  - These can be designated by the leading "*Athena*..."
  - These packages aren't seen as a 3rd party dependency as they are all made by the "same party"

#### Python Version
- Supported Python versions: **3.10**
  - Other older versions of Python are not currently supported. 
  - These older versions will probably not be supported by [@AndreasSas](https://github.com/AndreasSas) himself, but if you want to contribute to the project and make this package compatible with older versions of Python, Pull requests are always welcome.

## Quick Example
The following example is a working bot, but currently only meant as proof of work as the package is still in its early stages of being developed and needs some heavy tuning.

Stay tuned for updates while we work on this on [stream](https://www.twitch.tv/directiveathena) or come hang out in the [discord](https://discord.com/invite/6JcDbhXkCH).
