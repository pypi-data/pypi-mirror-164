# ipynb_strip_copy

Command line tool to detect text in a jupyter notebook cell and process as .  
Allows one to maintain a "rubric" `ipynb` file from which the 
"solution" and "student" copies can be created quickly.

## Installation

    pip install ipynb_strip_copy

## Usage / Example

Open up [test_cli_hw_rub.ipynb](test/test_cli_hw_rub.ipynb) and use the 
command line interface via the jupyter magic command `!`:

    !python -m ipynb_strip_copy test_cli_hw.ipynb -t hw

Which:
- creates `test_cli_hw_sol.ipynb` by:
    - removing any cell with the string 'rubric'
    - raising an error on any cell with the string 'todo'
- creates `test_cli_hw.ipynb` by:
    - removing any cell with the string 'rubric'
    - removing any cell with the string 'solution'
    - raising an error on any cell with the string 'todo'

See the [prep_hw() function](ipynb_strip_copy/prep.py) for implementation 
details.  (todo: formalize some config file or similar to allow users to 
define their own search strings and actions.)

## Notes
  - string matching is case-insensitive
  - there is a RM_COMPLEMENT action, which removes all cells which do not 
    contain some search string
