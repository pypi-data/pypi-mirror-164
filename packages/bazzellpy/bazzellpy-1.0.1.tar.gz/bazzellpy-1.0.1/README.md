`bazzellpy` allows you to call [IntelTechniques Search Tools](https://inteltechniques.com/tools) as functions in your Python program.

Michael Bazzell's useful suite of OSINT tools are a great start for any investigation. I wanted to be able to call on these tools without having to re-paste code when working on more complex projects. I've made this library available so you can too.

***Michael Bazzell has not endorsed this library and any references to his person are merely to give him due credit for publishing his tools. I am in no way affiliated with IntelTechniques or Michael Bazzell.***
