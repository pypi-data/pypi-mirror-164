# dsolve

A package to solve systems of dynamic equations with Python. It understands
Latex syntax and it requires minimum specifications from the user end. It implements the Klein (2000) algorithm, which allows for static equations. 

The main usage of the package is the following (check the notebook for further examples)
```python
from solvers import Klein

# Your latex equations here as a list of strings
eq=[
    '\pi_{t}=\beta*E\pi_{t+1}+\kappa*y_{t}+u_{t}',
    'y_{t}=Ey_{t+1}+(1-\phi)*E[\pi_{t+1}]+\epsilon_{t}',
    '\epsilon_{t} = \rho_v*\epsilon_{t-1}+v_{t}'
]

# Your calibration here as a dictionary
calibration = {'\beta':0.98,'\kappa':0.1,'\phi':1.1,'\rho_v':0.8}

# Define pre-determined variables, forward looking variables, and shocks as strings separated by commas or a list of strings.

x = '\epsilon_{t-1}'
p = '\pi_t, y_t'
z = 'v_t, u_t'

system = Klein(eq = eq, x=x, p=p, z=z, calibration=calibration)
```

## Flexible input reading

The standarized way to write a variable is `E_{t}[x_{s}]` to represent the expectation of `x_{s}` at time `t`. but `dsolve` understands other formats. `Ex_{s}`, `E[x_s]` and `Ex_s` are quivalents to  `E_{t}[x_{s}]`, and the subscript `t` is assumed. 

Greek symbols can be writen as `\rho` or just `rho`. Â´

`dsolve` understands fractions and sums. `\sum_{i=0}^{2}{x_{i,t}}` produces `x_{0,t}+x_{1,t}+x_{2,t}`
