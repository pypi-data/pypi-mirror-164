class Statistics:

    Object that compiles statistics on a list of arbitrary objects.

    is used to get the values on which the statistics will be computed.

    The value returned by the key may be a multidimensional object, i.e.:
    a tuple or a list, as long as the registered statistical function
    supports it. For example, statistics can be computed directly on
    multi-objective fitness when using numpy statistical function.
