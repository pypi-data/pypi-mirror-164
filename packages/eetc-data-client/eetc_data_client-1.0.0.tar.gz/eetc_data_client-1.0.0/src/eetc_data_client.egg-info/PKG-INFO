print(aapl_price_data_df.head())

china_exports_data = client.get_macroeconomic_data(
    "Exports in USD - China", frequency="Monthly",
)
print(china_exports_data.head())
```

```python
"""
Getting historical fundamentals data for AAPL.
"""

# Development

## System requirements
To run the project locally and work on it, you need the following:
- Python 3.8+

## Project setup
```commandline
sudo apt-get install build-essential
make update_and_install_python_requirements
```

## Adding a new Python package
1. Add the package name to `requirements.in`
2. Run:
```commandline
make update_and_install_python_requirements
```

## Publishing new package versions to PyPi
1. Update `[build_system]` section in `pyproject.toml` in case new dependencies are added or existing dependency versions were updated.
2. Update `version` field in `[project]` section in `pyproject.toml` whenever there is a new change to the project.
3. Build the project using command:
```commandline
python -m build
```
4. Publish package on PyPi Test, run command:
```commandline
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```
4. If everything is ok on PyPi Test, publish on "real" PyPi using the command:
```commandline
python -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```
