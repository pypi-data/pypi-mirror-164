Examples
--------
Have a look at the [example script](../master/example.py) to see how to 
use the module. The [stress/stress.py script](../master/stress/stress.py) 
stresses the taskfarm server by spawning multiple clients. You can use the 
[stress/plot.py script](../master/stress/plot.py) to plot the csv files 
produced by the stress script.
