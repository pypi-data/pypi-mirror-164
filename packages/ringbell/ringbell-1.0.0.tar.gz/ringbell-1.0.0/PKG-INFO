        Python package for playing a sound when a task is complete. The callbacks additionally works also within jupyter notebook,
        so that if you are working on a notebook on a remote machine it plays the audio within your browser and not in the server.
        
        How do I install this package?
        ----------------------------------------------
        You will need a couple packages that you might not already have installed:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            sudo apt install python3-dev
            sudo apt install libasound2-dev
        
        Finally as usual, just download it using pip:
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            pip install ringbell
        
        
        Usage examples
        -----------------------------------------------
