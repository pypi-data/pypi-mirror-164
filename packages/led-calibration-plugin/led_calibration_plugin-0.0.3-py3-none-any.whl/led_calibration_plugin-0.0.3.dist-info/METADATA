## Pioreactor LED calibration plugin 

This plugin offers the ability to calibrate your LEDs using an external light probe. To perform this calibration, insert your vial containing media into the Pioreactor and submerge your light probe. The plugin will increase the light intensity, and prompt you to record the readings from your light probe. A calibration line of best fit will be generated based on your light probe readings. 

## Installation instructions 

Install from the command line. 

```
pio install-plugin led_calibration_plugin
```

Then run by typing into your command line: 

```
pio run led_calibration
```
