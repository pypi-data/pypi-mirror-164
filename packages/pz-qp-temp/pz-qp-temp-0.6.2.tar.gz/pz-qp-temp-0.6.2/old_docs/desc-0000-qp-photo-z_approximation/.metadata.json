    "description": "Upcoming and ongoing galaxy surveys will produce photo-z probability distribution functions (PDFs) in addition to traditional photo-z point estimates.  However, the storage of photo-z PDFs may present a challenge as the dataset size increases, as we face a trade-off between the accuracy of subsequent science measurements and the storage cost. We investigate a number of different PDF approximations, using metrics that quantify performance in both large scale structure and weak gravitational lensing studies. In the process, we present qp, a Python library enabling the evaluation of various approximations of 1-dimensional PDFs, as suitable for photometric redshifts.",
