Description: taskfarm
        ========
        This package solves the problem of managing a loosely coupled taskfarm where
        there are many tasks and the workers are entitrly independent of each other.
        Instead of using a farmer process a database is used to hand out new tasks to
        the workers. The workers contact a web application via http(s) to get a new
        task.
        
        You can use the [taskfarm-worker](https://github.com/mhagdorn/taskfarm-worker)
        to connect to the taskfarm service.
        
        See the [documentation](https://taskfarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for installation instructions.
