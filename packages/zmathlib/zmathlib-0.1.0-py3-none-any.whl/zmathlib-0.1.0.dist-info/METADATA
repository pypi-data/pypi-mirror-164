## Features

- You can do math using our module easily.
- By using just add, sub, mul, div keywords.
- Easy to use it in your projects.

## Installation

Install my-project with pip

```bash
  pip install zmathplotlib
```
    
## Usage/Examples
### Using two variable

```python
from zmathlib import *

a = 5
b = 6

add = add(a,b)
sub = sub(a,b)
mul = mul(a,b)
div = div(a,b)

print(add)
print(sub)
print(mul)
print(div)
```

### Using multiple variable

```python
from zmathlib import *

a = 5
b = 6
c = 7
d = 4

add = add(a,b,c,d)
sub = sub(a,b,c,d)
mul = mul(a,b,c,d)
div = div(a,b.c,d)

print(add)
print(sub)
print(mul)
print(div)
```


## Roadmap

- Add more feactures.
- Make it a all in one math module.
