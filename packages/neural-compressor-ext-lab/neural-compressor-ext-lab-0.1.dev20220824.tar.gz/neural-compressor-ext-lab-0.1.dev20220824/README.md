# Neural-Compressor-EXT-LAB


## Requirements

- JupyterLab >= 3.0

## Install

### Python Backend
To install the Python source code, execute:
```bash
python setup.py install
```
Note: After the extension is published to the PyPI or conda-forge repositories, you can easily install the extension using pip or conda, such as:
```bash
pip install neural-compressor-ext-lab
```
### Javascript/Typescript Front-end
Install lab extension from source code with:
```bash
jupyter labextension install --py neural-compressor-ext-lab
```
Note: After the extension is published to the NPM repositories, you can easily install the extension from jupyter lab extension market and don't need to execute the above command manually.

## Debugging
Check if the package has been added into the extension list:
```bash
jupyter labextension list
jupyter serverextension list
```
If the neural-compressor-ext-lab is not in ```serverextension``` list, try to enable the package to become a server extension:
```bash
jupyter serverextension enable --py neural-compressor-ext-lab
```
*debugging tip* ï¼šif the enable fails, try running:
```bash
jupyter lab --ServerAPP.jpserver_extension="{'neural-compressor-ext-lab':True}" --debug
```

## Uninstall

To remove the extension, execute:

```bash
pip uninstall neural-compressor-ext-lab
```
## Access jupyter lab remotely using SSH

Launch the jupyter lab service on the remote server:
```bash
jupyter lab --no-browser --port=8889
```
Start SSH in a local terminal:
```bash
ssh -N -f -L localhost:8888:localhost:8889 username@serverIP
```
## Contributing

### Development install

Note: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.

The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.

```bash
# Clone the repo to your local environment
# Change directory to the Neural_Coder directory
# Install package in development mode
pip install -e .
# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes
jlpm build
```

You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.

```bash
# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed
jlpm watch
# Run JupyterLab in another terminal
jupyter lab
```

With the watch command running, every saved change will immediately be built locally and available in your running JupyterLab. Refresh JupyterLab to load the change in your browser (you may need to wait several seconds for the extension to be rebuilt).

By default, the `jlpm build` command generates the source maps for this extension to make it easier to debug using the browser dev tools. To also generate source maps for the JupyterLab core extensions, you can run the following command:

```bash
jupyter lab build --minimize=False
```

### Development uninstall

```bash
pip uninstall neural-compressor-ext-lab
```

In development mode, you will also need to remove the symlink created by `jupyter labextension develop`
command. To find its location, you can run `jupyter labextension list` to figure out where the `labextensions`
folder is located. Then you can remove the symlink named `Neural_Coder` within that folder.

### Testing the extension

#### Frontend tests

This extension is using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript code testing.

To execute them, execute:

```sh
jlpm
jlpm test
```

#### Integration tests

This extension uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro/) for the integration tests (aka user level tests).
More precisely, the JupyterLab helper [Galata](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/tree/master/galata) is used to handle testing the extension in JupyterLab.

More information are provided within the [ui-tests](./ui-tests/README.md) README.

### Packaging the extension

See [RELEASE](RELEASE.md)
