===========================================
Wigner-Ville Distribution of Gaussian Atoms
===========================================

This example shows the WV distribution of four Gaussian atoms, each localized
at the corner of a rectangle in the time-frequency plane. The distribution does
show the four signal terms, as well as six interference terms.

Figure 4.4 from the tutorial.
