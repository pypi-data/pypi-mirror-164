Description: # Cronaion
        
        Watcher
        
        * A scheduler for your python programs.
        * Easily schedule with a cronjob string.
        * Very light on cpu as there are just sleeps called, not a while loop checker.
        * Everything is run as a thread.
          * Note this means that you can easily use objects and non-picklable data types. However this means programs using Aion will only run on a single GIL and will be bound to a single core on a CPU. Process intensive tasks should not be used with Aion.

        watcher = Aion()
        
        @watcher.watch("1 3 * * 0")
        def check_the_mail():
            print("I will run at 03:01 every Sunday.")
        
        @watcher.watch("*/1 * * * *")
        def blink_my_eyes():
            print("I will run every 30 seconds.")
        
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            watcher.start()
        ```
