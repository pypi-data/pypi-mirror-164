    'long_description': '# dynamic-world 🛰️\n\nWrapper package around [Google\'s Dynamic World App](https://dynamicworld.app/) [^1], to easily monitor forests and calculate their co2 storage on a near-real time.\n\n[^1]: This dataset is produced for the Dynamic World Project by Google in partnership with National Geographic Society and the World Resources Institute.\n\n## Install\n\n```zsh\npip install dynamic-world\n```\n\nAn external C library is required as well: [GDAL](https://gdal.org/download.html). The [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) already has GDAl installed. If working locally, an easy way to install it is by running `conda install -c conda-forge gdal`\n\n## Google Earth Engine authentication\n\nThis package runs computation on Earth Engine and needs to be authenticated beforehand. See the [authentication](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install#authentication) from a Jupyter notebook, or alternatively using a [private key](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/service_account#use-a-service-account-with-a-private-key) creating a [service account](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/service_account).\n\n\n## Usage\n\nGiven a Forest (defined as a directory with some configuration files, see bellow), this package retrieves statistics and images of it.\nSee [Jupyter tutorial](Notebooks/dynamic_world_tutorial.ipynb) for a usage example.\n\n### Forests\n\nEach forest (or "proyect") is defined inside a directory with a given name and 2 files:\n\n1. A forest_config.yml (name is mandatory) which looks like this:\n\n```yaml\n# Name of the forest/proyect\nname: Sample\n\n# Locations of the geojson file\ngeojson: \'./sample.geojson\'\n\n# Co2 factor: how many tons of CO2 are stored on average per hectare\nco2_factor: {\n    \'trees\': 591.85,\n    \'grass\': 6,\n    \'bare\': 6,\n    \'crops\': 11.5,\n    \'flooded_vegetation\': 6,\n    \'other\': 0,\n    \'factor_pixel\': 100, # Indicates how many pixels are (on average) inside a hectare\n  }\n\n# Date in which the reforestation started, in format YYYY-mm-dd\nstart_date: \'2022-01-01\'\n```\n\n2. A valid geojson file [see](https://geojson.org/) (named as defined in forest_config.yml) that defines the area\n\nInternally, forests are stored as a ForestConfig instance (see dynamic_world.configurations for more details).\n\n### Available calculations\n\nGiven a forest and a pair of dates, we download the forest\'s landcover image, landcover statistics and total CO2 calculation. In other words, we mean the amount of CO2 (measured in tons) that a forest stores (and therefore is not released into the atmosphere if it was burned :D)\n\nThe forest image is stored as a [Cloud Optimized Geotiff](https://www.cogeo.org/) file. The expression used for the file-name is the following:\n\n```python\nf"{forest.name.replace(\' \', \'_\')}_{start_date}_{end_date}.cog.tif"\n```\n\nFor [reductions](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/reducers_intro) we use the Mode (polling). If a very large time interval is specified, recent changes in the forest will be masked by old pixel values. It is encouraged to use the smallest possible time intervals (at least a week is required or there may not be data). However, depending on some factors (such as the amount of clouds), specifying a small time interval may result in many NA (see mrv.calculations documentation for further info on how NA are treated when calculating the co2 factor).\n\n---\n\n# Development notes\n\nWe encourage developers to open the repository using [VSCode remote container functionality](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).\n\n## Secrets\n\nTo run the tests, you will need only one secret, which is Earth Engine\'s [service account](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/service_account) base64-encoded:\n\n```\nSERVICE_ACCOUNT=<very-long-string>\n```\n\nThe following snippet can be used to base64-encode the `service_account.json` file:\n```console\npython <<HEREDOC\nimport base64\nwith open(\'service_account.json\', \'rb\') as file:\n    file = file.read()\n    base64_encoded_data = base64.b64encode(file)\n    base64_message = base64_encoded_data.decode(\'utf-8\')\nprint(base64_message)\nHEREDOC\n```\n\n## How to run tests locally\n\n```zsh\n# In the root directory of the proyect\npytest\n\n# Run coverage \npytest --cov mrv --cov-branch --cov-report term-missing --disable-warnings\n```\n\n## How to run tests in docker\n\n```zsh\n# Build test docker\ndocker build --tag dw --file Dockerfile --target dev .\n\n# Run lint and tests\ndocker run dw /bin/bash -c "flake8 && pytest"\n```\n',
