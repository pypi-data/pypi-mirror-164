It might be the simplest creature on the Island to hunt, and while it only provides a small amount of meat and chitin, an easy meal is always of value on the Island. Unlike nearly every other creature on the Island, Achatina does not defecate normally. Instead, it secretes a thick, sticky substance. Achatina leaves trails of this slime, but the trails are so thin that they crumble to dust quickly.\nDomesticated\nThere is a very disgusting, but useful fact about Achatina that causes tribes to seek to tame them: its secretions are chemically similar to the "Cementing Paste" and "Organic Polymer" used by many tribes for building materials. Tamed Achatina naturally accumulates this slime over time, which can then be collected at the tribe\'s convenience. Legend has it that Achatina can be tamed with a special "cake" made from harvested crops & resources.\n„\n~ Helena')

Typically found among the deepest, darkest expanses of the ocean, this creature preys on smaller fish while being an excellent source of food for larger predators. Melanocetus has an array of bioluminescent light pods at the end of stalks on its head. Like typical Anglerfish, it primarily uses these to attract smaller creatures and trick them into coming close enough for Melanocetus to consume the prey. This often makes wild Melanocetus itself relatively easy to spot among the briny depths.\nDomesticated\nExploring the depths of the ocean can be difficult. The cold, the lack of air, and the shocking absence of light combine to make travel very dangerous. A tamed Anglerfish can use the natural light at the end of its stalks to illuminate the depths, making exploration not only safer but more lucrative, as I've heard some survivors use this creature to harvest the silica pearls found throughout the ocean's depths!\n„\n~ Helena")

I believe they can afford to stick with smaller groups because of their incredibly thick skin, for which they're named. Despite not being among the largest of the Island's herbivores, Ankylosaurus is one of the more difficult creatures to take down. Its thick, armored skin seems to make it more than a match for several of the mid-sized predators that would otherwise hunt it. Reckless carnivores are just as likely to hurt themselves on Ankylosaurus' spikes, as they are to get hit by its tail.\nDomesticated\nWithout a doubt, the best trait of a trained Ankylosaurus is its enormously dense tail. This tail is powerful enough to quickly shatter the resource-laden rocks of the Island. One of the wealthier human tribes on the island utilizes a squad of Ankylosaurs in its mines and quarries. The creature's affinity for metal enables it to carry raw ore at an effectively reduced weight.\n„\n~ Helena")

It has so many of the nightmare inducing traits of spiders from among many family and genus. It fires webbing like a bola spider, it spits venom like a lynx spider. It has a poisonous bite like a myriad of spiders, and can see in the dark by sensing vibrations. And to top it off, Araneomorphus is larger than an adult human! If that wasn't enough, I'm convinced that some of the caves on the island have actually been dug by Araneomorphus, but this worries me. Either Araneomorphus is a colony-spider (like ants), or there is a much larger Araneomorphus somewhere on the island.\nDomesticated\nAs long as it is kept far from arachnophobics, domesticated Araneomorphus makes an excellent guardian creature for anyone wanting to avoid killing. Their strange web-spraying behavior is also quite helpful while hunting fast, fleeing prey. They are too small to be used as mounts, however...\n„\n~ Helena")

Like the island's other Arthropods, Arthropluera Felsanguis has become much larger than I might have believed possible. It's a very aggressive hunter, but prefers to eat meat after it has rotted for some time, and will voraciously seek out such delicacies.\nKnown Information\nArthropluera's blood has a very low pH, to the point that it can dissolve many materials. This acidic blood splashes back on anything that directly attacks it, weakening the durability of weapons and hurting attackers. Many creatures thusly refuse to prey on Arthropluera, fearing this unique defense. If that wasn't enough, Arthropluera also keeps a small reservoir of blood ready to spit at its prey.\nDomesticated\nLike most of the arthropods on the island, Arthropluera is simple minded and relatively easy to tame. It is an almost entirely military mount, useful mostly for attacking at a distance. Thanks to its unique defenses, whether hunting or warring, Arthropluera is generally safe from all but the largest of creatures.\n„\n~ Helena")

While not as powerful as some deep-sea predators or Spinosaurus, Baryonyx is an extremely fast swimmer who is still sufficiently nimble enough to threaten most creatures on the Island. And yet despite being a fast, dangerous dinosaur, Baryonyx almost exclusively consumes fish and other water-dwellers. The highly specific metabolism of Baryonyx seems to allow it to heal wounds almost preternaturally fast after feeding on nutritious fish meat. Perhaps this is why Baryonyx rarely attacks land animals?\nDomesticated\nBaryonyx's natural affinity for aquatic predation means that once tamed; it learns to kill ocean-dwellers even more efficiently. Between its speed and its power, Baryonyx makes an ideal choice for anyone interested in frequently moving between water and land travel, and who values speed and agility over raw strength.\n„\n~ Helena")

Because so many creatures prey on it, Diplocaulus has become very skittish and often flees at the first sign of trouble. It uses its amphibious nature to escape into whichever environment its predator isn't native to. Diplocaulus' unique capability to retain vast quantities of oxygen allows it to effectively remain submerged for hours at a time, usually outlasting even other amphibious creatures that might otherwise prey upon it.\nDomesticated\nThere are only a few uses for tamed Diplocaulus. It is primarily kept for the (rather disgusting) practice of employing a Diplocaulus as an oxygen bag. Diplocaulus stores air in the bladders of its head, and divers can suck from these bladders to take deep breaths while submerged, supporting long-term underwater exploration without the use of external gear. Surprisingly, Diplocaulus is also extremely efficient when it comes to hunting Trilobites.\n„\n~ Helena")

Although not as robust as what you might find within a village, this utility helped him live a nomadic, solitary lifestyle.

Unlike most of the other theropods, it is a primarily nocturnal creature. As dawn approaches, Megalosaurus begins looking for a secluded place to spend the day sleeping in relative safety. Conversely, if disturbed during the day, Megalosaurus is significantly more sluggish. Either way, however, its primary combat tactic is to bite onto its target, then lock its jaw shut in an iron grip. Only larger creatures can hope to break free once Megalosaurus locks its jaw. The creature then proceeds to gnaw on its prey until death. It's a terrifying, grisly spectacle to watch, and a formidable tactic for a tribe to employ against more nimble opponents.\nDomesticated\nWhile Megalosaurus is not the most powerful theropod, it is still highly sought after by night-raiders. Due to its nocturnal nature, Megalosaurus becomes much more formidable at night, dodging attacks, conserving stamina, and attacking more accurately, to name a few of its enhanced talents.\n„\n~ Helena")

Like most griffinflies, Meganeura is carnivorous, but it is typically not aggressive towards humans unless provoked or challenged for food. It lives primarily in the wetter, heavily wooded areas, such as the jungles. Meganeura is a natural predator of most of the smaller insects on the island. Though not often aggressive, Meganeura will not turn down a free meal.

Spinosaurus' four legs and large sail make it fairly swift on land and incredibly fast in the water. Its marvel is, arguably, the ability to change stances by going from quadruped to biped. The creature is visually distinguished by its spectacular sail. In my travels I have seen many different and brightly coloured sails, as every Spinosaurus appears to have a slightly different palette. The one comforting fact about Spinosaurus is that it seems more at home near water than away from it. Although the creature is more powerful, faster, agile, and insatiable while in water, it tends to become less hostile as it gets farther from it. On one occasion, I only escaped a Spinosaurus by getting far enough from its lake home to make it simply lose interest.\nDomesticated\nSpinosaurus is an incredibly well-rounded apex carnivore. Faster than a Tyrannosaurus in water and able to travel on land unlike a Megalodon, its all-terrain versatility may be unrivaled. Although its movement speed is slower in a biped stance, it gains considerable attacking strength and mobility in this form. For hunters who wish to have a well-rounded mount, Spinosaurus may be the ideal choice -- if they can acquire one.\n„\n~ Helena")

This is contrary to the alternating rows on Stegosaurus fossils I've seen in museums. Not surprisingly, Stegosaurus uses the spines on its tail to defend itself. While not aggressive, Stegosaurus will come to the aid of another nearby Stegosaurus. This implies it to be a herd animal.\nDomesticated\nStegosaurus is commonly used as a safe way to transport large quantities of goods. And once you saddle one up, not even an Argentavis could knock you off that perch. A stegosaurus can be trained to flex its back plates for different purposes: hardened to shield it from attack, in a heavier alignment that deals crippling blows, or oriented more sharply to pierce armor. These various plate configurations also come in handy for stripping wood from trees, gathering thatch, or foraging for wild berries, respectively. Stegosaurus can knock back or impale with a whip of its spiky tail, keeping predators at bay or pinning them in place. Its spiked appendage also helps for gathering berries—go figure.\n„\n~ Helena")

This extremely large snake, while being a member of the Titanoboa family, does not constrict its prey as most boas do. I believe this adaptation comes from coexisting with giant insects. However, the Titanoboa's venomous bite is so potent that it is known to paralyze far larger creatures. Titanoboa has developed a strange coexistence with other creatures of the Island's caves. Being immune to knockout poisons, and being unable to pierce the thick chitin of the insects, the species have learned to coexist.

It is much more agile than its smaller brethren, but even more noticeable are its pincer claws.

This allows it to trap multiple targets in its vice like grip, or hold an enemy in one claw while it smashes a second foe with the other.\nDomesticated\nMany survivors have found Karkinos to be an excellent war steed, as it can snatch enemy riders from their mounts, or grab and throw smaller creatures.

Apis Drones can be seen swarming around the nest in groups, but to get a look at the Queen Apis, one would need to crack open the nest itself. Speaking from experience, this is not a pleasant task, as the untameable Apis Drones are quite territorial. I probably should have seen that one coming, in hindsight. Take caution: Apis stings will significantly weaken any creature which suffers them, and because its stinger is not barbed, Apis can sting multiple times without its stinger being ripped away.\nDomesticated\nA tamed Apis Queen will lay new drone eggs, and construct a nest that survivors can farm for honey, so long as they remember to wear specialized bee-keeping gear.

These large wings are not only ideal for catching air currents over its ocean hunting grounds, but they also let Tropeognathus draft off of other flying creatures by flying behind them. While not the fastest flyer on the Isles, when combined with its remarkable stamina, this makes Tropeognathus well suited for long distance flight. Because it’s on the wing so much, Tropeognathus is best snared by those riding another flier. I've noticed the more clever tribespeople using chain bolas to capture them while airborne.\nDomesticated\nOnce tamed, Tropeognathus has proven quite useful to the people of the Isles beyond mere transportation. For example, its toothed beak can grind down many common goods to their base components, which is a great way to recycle items and gear! Well, so long as you have a rag handy to wipe off the spit... That bite is punishing enough to crack armor and grind through it over time, and Tropeognathus can blow away flora and fauna alike with a gust from its wings. Air-to-air combat is where this creature really shines, though. And with the right tools, some survivors have managed to fit them with a saddle-mounted flak cannon and jet engine for maximum lethality. Trust me, you haven't lived until you've ridden a jet-powered pterosaur into a dogfight. Saddle one up and see for yourself - you can be my wingman anytime!\n„\n~ Helena")

The horns of the Carnotaurus seem to be used more for fighting rivals than actual hunting. This doesn't mean the horns aren't dangerous, though. They can still eviscerate larger prey. Carnotaurus is one of the smaller and more compact of the large predators. If Tyrannosaurus is the “lion” of the Island, Carnotaurus would certainly be the “cheetah.” The real threat of a Carnotaurus is not being able to escape it once it has spotted you.\nDomesticated\nCarnotaurus fills a very specific role.

It is very territorial, however, and the entire family, young and old, will turn against an encroaching creature at just the slightest provocation. A memorable scene to stumble upon is a group of Chalicotherium playing. One odd playtime activity for Chalicotherium is hurling large balls of snow or.. mud-rocks(?).. at each other. Smaller creatures in the area shy away from Chalicotherium during this exertion, for fear of being buried in snow or "gravel."\nDomesticated\nWhile many creatures are useful while attacking a fortress, Chalicotherium can be trained as mobile artillery.

Once in range, it uses refined Element claws with lethal force.\nMQ-9X was clearly designed for urban combat. Its claws and shock absorbers let it scale walls and drop down to street level from significant heights, and we've only seen it patrolling within the city limits. Possibly the remnant of an automated police force or defensive army.\nRecommendations: Isolate, and engage at range in wide open spaces. I've calculated its maximum teleportation distance as roughly 15 meters, so maintain that gap as long as possible\nPersonal Use\nEvery MQ-9X I've encountered is stuck on a defensive loop, and overriding its primary directive is impossible. However, if we're able to acquire an intact processing core from a hostile unit, with enough parts I could reverse engineer our own, more loyal model. Could be useful - the grooves on its back are suited for a rider, so we wouldn't even need to build saddles.\n„\n~ Santiago")

Aside from size, the main difference between Draconis vipera and its larger cousin is that the former possesses only two legs, like an avian. Otherwise, it is quite similar, with armored scales, leathery wings and the ability to spew projectiles from a pair of glands inside its mouth. The nature of these projectiles is tied directly to the color of Draconis' scales. Some spit fire while others unleash poisonous acid or even bursts of bioelectricity.\nDomesticated\nI can imagine no flying mount more deadly than Draconis vipera. Its strength, toughness and ability rain death upon one's enemies makes it unmatched in combat. The few creatures that it cannot immediately overpower, it can outmaneuver.

Owls are remarkable creatures, but they're not the type that could survive an extinction level event on their own. Since it never strays from the patch of frozen tundra we encountered, I believe the Obelisk was the key to its survival.\n\nClearly a descendant of modern Strigdae, Bubo shares many traits with its smaller ancestors. For example, it excretes waste in the form of pellets, which make excellent fertilizer, and their large wings let them save energy during long, silent flights. They even hunt in the same way: by diving towards the ground to attack their prey with powerful talons.\n\nHowever, these talons also secrete a chemical with a high freezing point to slow down their prey, and they can even unleash this chemical in a wide cloud, temporarily freezing their foes.\nDomesticated\nWith its swift flying and frigid attacks, Bubo makes an excellent single-rider support mount or scout. The latter is helped by its tremendous vision, which it can share with its rider via its antenna. Not only does this make enemies easier to see, but Bubo can also spot Element veins with ease, even when they're underground.\n„\n~ Helena")

While said fins are folded inwards, Velonasaurus behaves like your average therapod, attacking with claws and teeth. However, when those fins are spread wide, Velonasaurus can rapidly fire a storm of spines at its prey. However, while in this state, its mobility is greatly hampered and it will eventually wear itself out.\n\nTherefore it sometimes prefers to unleash its spines in a single, deadly burst. By spinning around and firing a salvo of spines at the same time, Velonasaurus can defend itself from every angle at once.\nDomesticated\nGiven its versatility, Velonasaurus spinavultus makes an excellent single rider mount in most combat situations, but it's particularly effective when defending an entrenched position. It's like a living, breathing gatling gun. Just be careful when giving it a congratulatory hug or pat on the head. Getting spined by your own war steed would be a rather embarrassing way to go.\n„\n~ Helena")

While most aggressive theropods are relatively solitary creatures, Allosaurus lives in groups of 3. One Allosaurus is the alpha, while the others are its mates or a beta male. Like humans find value in forming a tribe, the Allosaurus has evolved to hunt in packs. Its saw-shaped teeth leave its prey bleeding and maimed, making escape difficult. Once an Allosaurus slows a creature with its cutting bite, the rest of its pack quickly closes in for the kill.\nDomesticated\nNot everyone thinks a tamed Allosaurus is ideal. Those who appreciate speed generally tame Carnotaurus, while those who value raw stopping power tame Tyrannosaurus. However, riders of Allosaurus tend to respect the utility of its Alpha pack status, which along with its bleed-inducing attacks and relative mobility, can effectively turn the tide of a combined arms battle.\n„\n~ Helena")

Be prepared to run or fight if you hear the call of the Utahraptor! The pack will repeat the calls and attack with much greater intensity. One of the faster creatures on the island, Utahraptor often uses their pack numbers to their advantage by swarming around their prey before it can react.

Rather than chase down smaller creatures, Utahraptor will pounce and pin its prey to the ground rather than chasing it around. Despite its normally aggressive nature, Utahraptors have become one of the primary combat mounts for roaming bands of raiders, as well as scouts for larger collectives.

Fortunately, Colossus petram's massive size makes it quite slow, so I would advise most survivors to flee immediately if encountering it in the wild. Colossus petram survives by slowly absorbing nearby minerals while in its dormant state, which consequently means that its body contains a wealth of metal ingots. If undisturbed, it can maintain this hibernation ad infinitum, but it will viciously attack anyone who encroaches upon its territory. A solitary creature, Colossus petram lives alone, and will not even protect its own kind.\nDomesticated\nIf somehow tamed, Colossus petram could prove to be an invaluable asset, particularly in a siege.

Spinosaurus' four legs and large sail make it fairly swift on land and incredibly fast in the water. Its marvel is, arguably, the ability to change stances by going from quadruped to biped. The creature is visually distinguished by its spectacular sail. In my travels I have seen many different and brightly coloured sails, as every Spinosaurus appears to have a slightly different palette. The one comforting fact about Spinosaurus is that it seems more at home near water than away from it. Although the creature is more powerful, faster, agile, and insatiable while in water, it tends to become less hostile as it gets farther from it. On one occasion, I only escaped a Spinosaurus by getting far enough from its lake home to make it simply lose interest.\nDomesticated\nSpinosaurus is an incredibly well-rounded apex carnivore. Faster than a Tyrannosaurus in water and able to travel on land unlike a Megalodon, its all-terrain versatility may be unrivaled.

There are few wild predators that are able to pack-hunt alongside the generally hostile Carnotaurus, like the Yutyrannus does, with such ease.

Like all Parasaur, it has a signature crest on its head. Very docile at first, I've been able to approach the creature without disturbing it. If startled, however, the creature can vocalize a distress call to the surrounding area that warns of danger. Parasaurolophus appears to be low on the food chain and is hunted by everything, creatures and humans alike, which explains its skittish nature. It is a good source of meat and hide, if you can manage to keep up with it long enough to kill it.\nDomesticated\nDespite being what most tribes consider a relatively useless creature to tame, I once met an interesting woman who had tamed an entire herd of them. She informed me that many overlooked the creature's potential. She even graciously gifted me a fancy saddle to put on my own Parasaurolophus one day. As a relatively simple creature to domesticate, Parasaurolophus is commonly one of the first mounts a tribe will be able to acquire. Its ability to run relatively fast for lengthy intervals makes it a solid mode of medium-range transportation, though it has almost no ability to defend itself or its rider in a traditional sense. Smaller creatures, however, appear to be frightened by the horn of Parasaurolophus although it doesn't do much damage. It also has decent weight-bearing capabilities, which could prove useful for nomadic tribes as they work to establish a presence on the Island.\n„\n~ Helena")

It shares a similar silhouette with the Pteranodon, and nests near the absolute highest peaks. Upon closer inspection, though, Quetzalcoatlus is an enormous creature of tremendous power. I find it strange that such a large, imposing beast would be so skittish. Unlike other creatures of its size, it is more likely to flee than fight. I suppose the decision to flee from any trouble keeps the species alive on an island with so many dangerous predators. But then how does it eat enough to sustain its massive size?\nDomesticated\nTamed Quetzalcoatlus have a very specific role on the island. Too slow to be an efficient local transport, and too weak to be an effective warbird, the tribes I have encountered tend to employ it as a mass carrier.

Be prepared to run or fight if you hear the call of the Utahraptor! The pack will repeat the calls and attack with much greater intensity. One of the faster creatures on the island, Utahraptor often uses their pack numbers to their advantage by swarming around their prey before it can react. The large curved talon on the second toe of this sub-species seems particularly suited for dealing significant damage. Utahraptor prime usually kill its prey with numerous slashing and biting attacks in rapid sequence.\nDomesticated\nWhat the Utahraptor lacks in size, it makes up for in ingenuity. Rather than chase down smaller creatures, Utahraptor will pounce and pin its prey to the ground rather than chasing it around. Despite its normally aggressive nature, Utahraptors have become one of the primary combat mounts for roaming bands of raiders, as well as scouts for larger collectives. Those who ride Utahraptor claim they are difficult to tame, but then fiercely loyal. As a carnivore, once tamed they require a steady stream of meat to sustain.\n„\n~ Helena')

It is not able to intimidate every foe with its roar, but upon hearing it, it might scare the poop out of you - quite literally. Despite being a different sub-species of Tyrannosaurus, everyone I\'ve met still refers to them as a "Rex" or a "T-Rex". I\'ve long since stopped trying to convince anyone, especially the few who I\'ve encountered wearing Tyrannosaurus teeth as necklaces.\nDomesticated\nTaming a Tyrannosaurus is without a doubt the goal for any warlord or warring tribe.

This is contrary to the alternating rows on Stegosaurus fossils I've seen in museums. Not surprisingly, Stegosaurus uses the spines on its tail to defend itself. While not aggressive, Stegosaurus will come to the aid of another nearby Stegosaurus. This implies it to be a herd animal.\nDomesticated\nStegosaurus is commonly used as a safe way to transport large quantities of goods. And once you saddle one up, not even an Argentavis could knock you off that perch. A stegosaurus can be trained to flex its back plates for different purposes: hardened to shield it from attack, in a heavier alignment that deals crippling blows, or oriented more sharply to pierce armor. These various plate configurations also come in handy for stripping wood from trees, gathering thatch, or foraging for wild berries, respectively. Stegosaurus can knock back or impale with a whip of its spiky tail, keeping predators at bay or pinning them in place. Its spiked appendage also helps for gathering berries—go figure.\n„\n~ Helena")

The one comforting fact about Spinosaurus is that it seems more at home near water than away from it.

Daeodon is as mean as it looks, and any survivor who wanders too close will find that out the hard way. As an omnivore with a voracious appetite, Daeodon scavenges, forages, and hunts to survive.

In Equus, survivors will find a trusty steed or pack animal that can carry them swiftly across land. Taming an Equus has proven interesting, requiring carefully approaching the creature in the wild, mounting it, and then carefully soothing over time by feeding it vegetables. In fact, Equus' reliability has lead some survivors to construct special saddles for them. I even encountered a man who added extra saddle-pouches that doubled as mobile crafting stations for chemical supplies, foodstuffs, and other items. Although not as robust as what you might find within a village, this utility helped him live a nomadic, solitary lifestyle. Some survivors employ Equus to herd and wrangle other creatures with a specialized lasso. This tool is sometimes effective for self-defense as well, as Equus is limited in battle on its own...at least compared to aggressive prehistoric carnivores.\n„\n~ Helena")

Like all Parasaur, it has a signature crest on its head. Very docile at first, I've been able to approach the creature without disturbing it. If startled, however, the creature can vocalize a distress call to the surrounding area that warns of danger. Parasaurolophus appears to be low on the food chain and is hunted by everything, creatures and humans alike, which explains its skittish nature. It is a good source of meat and hide, if you can manage to keep up with it long enough to kill it.\nDomesticated\nDespite being what most tribes consider a relatively useless creature to tame, I once met an interesting woman who had tamed an entire herd of them. She informed me that many overlooked the creature's potential. She even graciously gifted me a fancy saddle to put on my own Parasaurolophus one day. As a relatively simple creature to domesticate, Parasaurolophus is commonly one of the first mounts a tribe will be able to acquire. Its ability to run relatively fast for lengthy intervals makes it a solid mode of medium-range transportation, though it has almost no ability to defend itself or its rider in a traditional sense. Smaller creatures, however, appear to be frightened by the horn of Parasaurolophus although it doesn't do much damage. It also has decent weight-bearing capabilities, which could prove useful for nomadic tribes as they work to establish a presence on the Island.\n„\n~ Helena")

Standing nearly three meters tall, it is among the largest jumping creatures I've heard of. It is a fairly peaceful herbivore that will immediately flee when aggressed upon. One of Procoptodon's most unique features is its pouch. Unlike many pouched marsupials, Procoptodon's pouch is relatively dry and has little in the way of sticky or oily fluids. I assume this is good for the Joey, but I have not figured out exactly why yet. Its other unique feature, powerful hind legs, can knock back aggression much larger in stature. Procoptodons show great precision when leaping as if they can accurately target the landing without fail. I've seen them effortlessly hop and land from heights that would flatten other creatures.\nDomesticated\nIt seems Procotopdon's knack for carrying things has increased its load-bearing capacity. Procoptodon's dry pouch makes it an excellent beast of burden that can carry far more than other creatures of its size.

It shares a similar silhouette with the Pteranodon, and nests near the absolute highest peaks. Upon closer inspection, though, Quetzalcoatlus is an enormous creature of tremendous power. I find it strange that such a large, imposing beast would be so skittish. Unlike other creatures of its size, it is more likely to flee than fight. I suppose the decision to flee from any trouble keeps the species alive on an island with so many dangerous predators. But then how does it eat enough to sustain its massive size?\nDomesticated\nTamed Quetzalcoatlus have a very specific role on the island.

Peaceful tribes use it to carry incredible quantities of resources, while warring tribes use it to mobilize their army. Its size and strength make it one of the unique creatures on the Island that can support a "platform" saddle. Unfortunately, its enormity means that the process of taming a Brontosaurus can take a very long time.

While said fins are folded inwards, Velonasaurus behaves like your average therapod, attacking with claws and teeth. However, when those fins are spread wide, Velonasaurus can rapidly fire a storm of spines at its prey. However, while in this state, its mobility is greatly hampered and it will eventually wear itself out.\n\nTherefore it sometimes prefers to unleash its spines in a single, deadly burst. By spinning around and firing a salvo of spines at the same time, Velonasaurus can defend itself from every angle at once.\nDomesticated\nGiven its versatility, Velonasaurus spinavultus makes an excellent single rider mount in most combat situations, but it's particularly effective when defending an entrenched position.

It clambers up large trees and waits to ambush passing prey by pouncing upon them. When something that large jumps onto a target, the victim becomes stunned and doesn't stand much of a chance. Thylacoleo's most notable fighting quality is its powerful jaws. Once it bites its prey, it locks its jaw in an iron grip that can hold most smaller creatures in place.

Of course, not all of Leedsichthys' meat is this high quality, but most of it is! While the demand for Leedsichthys meat is high, the fish is notoriously difficult to track and hunt. Between its large size, powerful attacks, incredible speed (when it turns to flee), and humankind's general ineptitude on open water, actually killing a Leedsichthys is one of the Island's more difficult tasks. The hunt for an extremely elusive breed of the fish, the fabled 'Great Albino' Leedsichthys has been known to drive otherwise-sensible men and women mad with obsession, as if all evil were visibly personified and made practically assailable in this one creature.\nDomesticated\nDespite its large size, and the fact that it may well be strong enough to carry heavy loads, Leedsichthys does not appear to be intelligent enough to tame.

Be prepared to run or fight if you hear the call of the Utahraptor! The pack will repeat the calls and attack with much greater intensity. One of the faster creatures on the island, Utahraptor often uses their pack numbers to their advantage by swarming around their prey before it can react. The large curved talon on the second toe of this sub-species seems particularly suited for dealing significant damage.

Rather than chase down smaller creatures, Utahraptor will pounce and pin its prey to the ground rather than chasing it around. Despite its normally aggressive nature, Utahraptors have become one of the primary combat mounts for roaming bands of raiders, as well as scouts for larger collectives.

Firstly, its grab slowly renders its victim unconscious, so death isn't the only concern. Secondly, its vampiric blood drain instantly revitalizes it, even during combat. Finally, if Tusoteuthis is losing the fight, it sprays a cloud of ink into the surrounding water, blinding its attackers to cover a sneaky escape.\nDomesticated\nOne of the major benefits of taming Tusoteuthis is harvesting its ink.

I believe they can afford to stick with smaller groups because of their incredibly thick skin, for which they're named. Despite not being among the largest of the Island's herbivores, Ankylosaurus is one of the more difficult creatures to take down. Its thick, armored skin seems to make it more than a match for several of the mid-sized predators that would otherwise hunt it. Reckless carnivores are just as likely to hurt themselves on Ankylosaurus' spikes, as they are to get hit by its tail.\nDomesticated\nWithout a doubt, the best trait of a trained Ankylosaurus is its enormously dense tail. This tail is powerful enough to quickly shatter the resource-laden rocks of the Island. One of the wealthier human tribes on the island utilizes a squad of Ankylosaurs in its mines and quarries. The creature's affinity for metal enables it to carry raw ore at an effectively reduced weight.\n„\n~ Helena")

It avoids the ground as much as possible, preferring to stay in the safety of the tree-line, where few predators can reach it. I've not seen an Archaeopteryx outright fly yet, so it's possible that they cannot generate enough lift to do more than glide long distances between perches. I'm not sure how a creature so fearful of the ground can be such a picky eater, but Archaeopteryx only seems to consume certain rare insect matter.

It is a small consolation for the Island's other avian creatures, then, that Argentavis seems to have little interest in anything alive. Quite apart from what I would have guessed, Argentavis does not have the stooped neck typical of modern buzzards and vultures. I don't know if it adapted this stronger neck to deal with the predators on the Island, or if its lineage derives from before the stooped neck became common in carrion-eating birds. Whichever it meant to be, it has enabled Argentavis to carry smaller creatures with its beak.\nDomesticated\nArgentavis is actually slower than the Island's far more common Pteranodon, but it possesses significantly more stamina and can sustain flight for approximately three times as long.

It lives primarily on flat, clear ground, where it can capitalize on its speed. Additionally, it seems to have no qualms about running away from larger predators instead of fighting. The horns of the Carnotaurus seem to be used more for fighting rivals than actual hunting. This doesn't mean the horns aren't dangerous, though. They can still eviscerate larger prey. Carnotaurus is one of the smaller and more compact of the large predators. If Tyrannosaurus is the “lion” of the Island, Carnotaurus would certainly be the “cheetah.” The real threat of a Carnotaurus is not being able to escape it once it has spotted you.\nDomesticated\nCarnotaurus fills a very specific role.

It would be about two-thirds the height of a human if it stood tall, but it rarely does. Hesperornis spends most of its time gliding along the surface of the water, where it is much more maneuverable. Hesperornis is barely a threat to any land-dwelling creature, as its legs are too short for it to move around effectively, but it is surprisingly fast in the water. It can easily hunt down fish and other small water-dwelling creatures.\nDomesticated\nNot particularly useful for hunting, and not being affectionate, Hesperornis is primarily kept for the eggs it produces after consuming much fish. When rendered correctly, the eggs separate into two useful substances. One is a protein substance that is high in calories, and the other is an oily liquid that is effectively the same as the Oil found in the ocean!\n„\n~ Helena')

The Hyaenodon is a very intelligent predator. Before engaging, it determines if the payoff for a fight is worth the risk of injury. Hyaenodon often prefers not to fight unless there is already weakened prey or a fresh carcass nearby. This temperament changes quickly, though, near the presence of injured creatures. Hyaenodon quickly becomes very aggressive... ...and the pack attacks with ruthless abandon.

It primarily eats fish, and its distinctive cries can be heard echoing over across the Island's many beaches. As you might expect from a seagull, Ichthyornis will flee at the slightest provocation. Ichthyornis is a versatile and opportunistic hunter. Its primary form of attack is to dive into the top layers of water and impale its prey. However, since its food source can be unpredictable, Ichthyornis has developed a keen ability to steal food from unsuspecting travelers. Their affinity for shiny objects leads them to sometimes knock tools and weapons out of the hands of unsuspecting Survivors, but Ichthyornis is too small to actually fly off with them.\nDomesticated\nIchthyornis surprised me by being a very loyal and very social creature, once tamed. It likes to ride on its owner's shoulder, and bring that person treats (in the form of fish, of course) which its beak-grip enhances with extra healing vitamins.

Adding to Kairuku\'s problems, a clever survivor discovered that refining Kairuku blubber (concentrating the particles in it) can yield a natural form of the same Polymer utilized in advanced tribes\' manufacturing processes. This has caused many tribes to hunt Kairuku extensively, a practice colloquially known as "Kairu Clubbing."\nDomesticated\nThere is no reason to tame Kairuku for combat, since they are useless at it.

Mammoths can grab and throw things with their powerful trunks, and manage a fearsome trumpeting roar with them as well. At first, I wondered how herds of Mammoths were able to find enough plant life to graze on. But then I saw them sweeping up thatch and foliage with their tusks, and stomping branches out of trees. Mammoths generally thrive in colder areas and have a herd mentality. They must spend much of their time travelling between the mountains' cold summit and more lush base. And maybe their herds are why the summits are so barren.\nDomesticated\nMammuthus steincaput is a difficult beast to domesticate. Not because they are inherently stubborn, but because knocking one out to begin the taming process takes great effort. Once tamed, however, Mammoths are one of the only creatures on the island that can uproot trees without shattering them, and their trunks are strong enough to lift and carry survivors and other smaller creatures. Lately, survivors have been saddling up their mammoths to ride in tandem. The more clever riders have even been outfitting their mammoth saddles with war drums.

It seems to have relatively poor stamina in comparison to its quick speed, however, making frequent pit stops on the beaches before taking off again. While other humans I've seen on the Island still insist on calling it a Pterodactyl, this is inaccurate. Pteranodon wyvernus's poor fighting and defensive skills mean they are likely to scavenge any number of dead animals rather than engage in dangerous combat with other creatures. They also flee at the slightest sign of trouble. Because of this, they are one of the most common creatures to be found darting across the Island's skies.\nDomesticated\nPteranodons seem to be among most popular flying companions from what I have witnessed, possibly because they are relatively easy to tame with a slingshot or bow.

Spinosaurus' four legs and large sail make it fairly swift on land and incredibly fast in the water. Its marvel is, arguably, the ability to change stances by going from quadruped to biped. The creature is visually distinguished by its spectacular sail. In my travels I have seen many different and brightly coloured sails, as every Spinosaurus appears to have a slightly different palette. The one comforting fact about Spinosaurus is that it seems more at home near water than away from it. Although the creature is more powerful, faster, agile, and insatiable while in water, it tends to become less hostile as it gets farther from it. On one occasion, I only escaped a Spinosaurus by getting far enough from its lake home to make it simply lose interest.\nDomesticated\nSpinosaurus is an incredibly well-rounded apex carnivore. Faster than a Tyrannosaurus in water and able to travel on land unlike a Megalodon, its all-terrain versatility may be unrivaled. Although its movement speed is slower in a biped stance, it gains considerable attacking strength and mobility in this form. For hunters who wish to have a well-rounded mount, Spinosaurus may be the ideal choice -- if they can acquire one.\n„\n~ Helena")

Not only does it decrease Tapejara's turning radius even at high speeds, but it apparently provides Tapejara with extra information to help it fly through the air with unparalleled grace. I've even seen Tapejara hover and strafe side-to-side in the air without moving forward at all. It's quite remarkable.

Essentially a walking mountain, it is an absolutely enormous Sauropod which has developed armored plates of bone protrusions all over its body. Between these plates and its unparalleled size, Titanosaurus is extremely difficult to put down. In addition, Titanosaurus seems outright immune to any sort of narcotic effects. They often inadvertently crush nearby creatures underfoot with every step they take. While most Sauropods ignore non-hostile creatures, Titanosaurs take issue with creatures invading its personal space. This is probably because they aggressively feed off any and all plants they can find. Titanosaurus eats constantly, which certainly helps recover health quickly, even after fighting off numerous carnivores such as Giganotosaurus.\nDomesticated\nIf ever a creature were too big, it would be Titanosaurus. You'll hardly see a Titanosaurus with just a saddle and a rider: its immense size can effectively carry a fortress, defensive emplacements, along with a small zoo.

She told me that she let "Troody" hunt a few of her tribe\'s smaller creatures for sport, and it eventually started following her everywhere. It seems that while Troodon is too intelligent to fall for the rote conditioning of "tranq-and-feed," it can instead gradually gain loyalty from a social approach that provides it with the opportunity to hunt.

Besides the obvious gap in size, most of the differences between Moloch sagittarius and its smaller relative lie in its thorns. Instead of being permanent parts of its skin, Moloch sagittarius' thorns are more like spines or quills that can be removed and regrown. In fact, it is even capable of shooting these spines from its tail as a method of self defense, and examination of these projectiles has revealed that they are coated in a lethal poison.\nDomesticated\nDespite its dangerous spines, Moloch sagittarius has proven to be an excellent mount for indirect combat. Its ranged attacks can wreak havoc in a pitched battle, particularly if other creatures are taking the enemy's attention.

Once saddled it can be used as a workbench, allowing for a mobile crafting station.\n„\n~ Helena")

Like them, it is a carrion bird that feeds on the decaying corpses of other animals, and is only aggressive when defending its meal. As such, survivors should take note when they see groups of Torgos arcam circling above. It means that a wounded creature or a bloody battle may be somewhere below.\nDomesticated\nDespite its impressive wingspan, Torgos arcam is not suitable as a pack animal, and is surprisingly light. Some survivors have even been known to keep a tame Torgos arcam perched on their shoulder.

These myths have often changed through the passing of time but one constant is the belief that fire represents cleansing and renewal. The Phoenix embodies this process through its everlasting cycle of death and renewal! Extreme heat-waves in the desert seem to initiate the rise of the Phoenix, while the end of this so-called "Super Heat" precipitated the creature\'s reversion into ashes. While the Phoenix seems ambivalent to most wildlife, if provoked its ferocity is evident in its ability to set targets aflame with a single bite.\nDomesticated\nAttempting to pacify a Phoenix is, quite literally, playing with fire. The Phoenix must be continually set ablaze in order to be tamed. I\'ve seen many turned into dust and ash in the attempt. After it has been pacified, the Phoenix will regain its vitality when it is aflame! Although its compact size prevents the Phoenix from being ridden, its aggressive enflaming has proved to be invaluable in battle. Plus, it can quickly roast up tasty cooked meat and refine raw ores at any time, as a living furnace!\n„\n~ Helena')

There is no biological or historical precedent for it. Its nearest relatives exist only in legend – mythical statues that could come to life like the Golem of Prague. That makes it all the more dangerous. What survivor could possibly expect a seemingly benign rock formation to suddenly spring to life and attack them? Fortunately, Colossus petram's massive size makes it quite slow, so I would advise most survivors to flee immediately if encountering it in the wild. Colossus petram survives by slowly absorbing nearby minerals while in its dormant state, which consequently means that its body contains a wealth of metal ingots. If undisturbed, it can maintain this hibernation ad infinitum, but it will viciously attack anyone who encroaches upon its territory. A solitary creature, Colossus petram lives alone, and will not even protect its own kind.\nDomesticated\nIf somehow tamed, Colossus petram could prove to be an invaluable asset, particularly in a siege. Only armor piercing rounds or explosives can harm it at all, and it will handily smash through stone structures.\n„\n~ Helena")

It might be the simplest creature on the Island to hunt, and while it only provides a small amount of meat and chitin, an easy meal is always of value on the Island. Unlike nearly every other creature on the Island, Achatina does not defecate normally. Instead, it secretes a thick, sticky substance. Achatina leaves trails of this slime, but the trails are so thin that they crumble to dust quickly.\nDomesticated\nThere is a very disgusting, but useful fact about Achatina that causes tribes to seek to tame them: its secretions are chemically similar to the "Cementing Paste" and "Organic Polymer" used by many tribes for building materials. Tamed Achatina naturally accumulates this slime over time, which can then be collected at the tribe\'s convenience.

Typically found among the deepest, darkest expanses of the ocean, this creature preys on smaller fish while being an excellent source of food for larger predators. Melanocetus has an array of bioluminescent light pods at the end of stalks on its head.

It rounds out what I consider to be the middle-bottom of the ecosystem, feeding on the tinier non-insect creatures of the Island while itself being a common snack for the larger carnivores. Because so many creatures prey on it, Diplocaulus has become very skittish and often flees at the first sign of trouble. It uses its amphibious nature to escape into whichever environment its predator isn't native to. Diplocaulus' unique capability to retain vast quantities of oxygen allows it to effectively remain submerged for hours at a time, usually outlasting even other amphibious creatures that might otherwise prey upon it.\nDomesticated\nThere are only a few uses for tamed Diplocaulus. It is primarily kept for the (rather disgusting) practice of employing a Diplocaulus as an oxygen bag. Diplocaulus stores air in the bladders of its head, and divers can suck from these bladders to take deep breaths while submerged, supporting long-term underwater exploration without the use of external gear. Surprisingly, Diplocaulus is also extremely efficient when it comes to hunting Trilobites.\n„\n~ Helena",

In fact, Equus' reliability has lead some survivors to construct special saddles for them. I even encountered a man who added extra saddle-pouches that doubled as mobile crafting stations for chemical supplies, foodstuffs, and other items. Although not as robust as what you might find within a village, this utility helped him live a nomadic, solitary lifestyle.

It's a terrifying, grisly spectacle to watch, and a formidable tactic for a tribe to employ against more nimble opponents.\nDomesticated\nWhile Megalosaurus is not the most powerful theropod, it is still highly sought after by night-raiders. Due to its nocturnal nature, Megalosaurus becomes much more formidable at night, dodging attacks, conserving stamina, and attacking more accurately, to name a few of its enhanced talents.\n„\n~ Helena",

Actually, it is a type of griffinfly, an extinct species of invertebrate that looked similar to dragonflies. Like most griffinflies, Meganeura is carnivorous, but it is typically not aggressive towards humans unless provoked or challenged for food. It lives primarily in the wetter, heavily wooded areas, such as the jungles. Meganeura is a natural predator of most of the smaller insects on the island. Though not often aggressive, Meganeura will not turn down a free meal. They quickly appear in large numbers to scavenge off the victims of Pulmonoscorpius, rendered unconscious and unable to defend themselves. Of course the insects do have to avoid the Pulmonoscorpius itself. I have noticed it is unwise to disturb a flock of feeding Meganeura.\nDomesticated\nThe size of the insects on the island confounds me. The way these creatures diffuse oxygen should limit their size but Meganeura (and other bugs) seem to be able to advance beyond this restraint.

This is contrary to the alternating rows on Stegosaurus fossils I've seen in museums. Not surprisingly, Stegosaurus uses the spines on its tail to defend itself. While not aggressive, Stegosaurus will come to the aid of another nearby Stegosaurus. This implies it to be a herd animal.\nDomesticated\nStegosaurus is commonly used as a safe way to transport large quantities of goods. And once you saddle one up, not even an Argentavis could knock you off that perch. A stegosaurus can be trained to flex its back plates for different purposes: hardened to shield it from attack, in a heavier alignment that deals crippling blows, or oriented more sharply to pierce armor. These various plate configurations also come in handy for stripping wood from trees, gathering thatch, or foraging for wild berries, respectively. Stegosaurus can knock back or impale with a whip of its spiky tail, keeping predators at bay or pinning them in place. Its spiked appendage also helps for gathering berries—go figure.\n„\n~ Helena",

This extremely large snake, while being a member of the Titanoboa family, does not constrict its prey as most boas do. I believe this adaptation comes from coexisting with giant insects. However, the Titanoboa's venomous bite is so potent that it is known to paralyze far larger creatures. Titanoboa has developed a strange coexistence with other creatures of the Island's caves. Being immune to knockout poisons, and being unable to pierce the thick chitin of the insects, the species have learned to coexist. They often hunt large prey together.\nDomesticated\nAs they appear immune to knockout poisons, Titanoboa exornantur is basically impossible to render unconscious.

Xenomyzon has developed a particular fondness for blood, and whenever possible, it will attempt to latch onto human subjects. Once it does, it injects a poison for which there are only two cures: A specialized antidote or time. I would not recommend the latter.\nDomesticated\nWhile Xenomyzon cannot be brought to heel, some survivors have stored them in fish baskets for other uses. This keeps the subject alive and contained, but not properly tamed.\n„\n~ Helena",

When hurt, they burrow underground to recover and protect themselves from further damage. Fortunately, they are highly susceptible to damage and burns from charge based light sources, and exploiting this weakness can save a survivor's life.\nDomesticated\nAll attempts to pacify a Nameless have failed.

Apis Drones can be seen swarming around the nest in groups, but to get a look at the Queen Apis, one would need to crack open the nest itself. Speaking from experience, this is not a pleasant task, as the untameable Apis Drones are quite territorial. I probably should have seen that one coming, in hindsight. Take caution: Apis stings will significantly weaken any creature which suffers them, and because its stinger is not barbed, Apis can sting multiple times without its stinger being ripped away.\nDomesticated\nA tamed Apis Queen will lay new drone eggs, and construct a nest that survivors can farm for honey, so long as they remember to wear specialized bee-keeping gear. Said honey is not only sweet and delicious, but laced with scents that land mammals find irresistible. Many hunters use it to bait their traps. Apis Drones will also follow their Queen into battle, so they can be used for self-defense in a pinch.\n„\n~ Helena',

These large wings are not only ideal for catching air currents over its ocean hunting grounds, but they also let Tropeognathus draft off of other flying creatures by flying behind them. While not the fastest flyer on the Isles, when combined with its remarkable stamina, this makes Tropeognathus well suited for long distance flight. Because it’s on the wing so much, Tropeognathus is best snared by those riding another flier. I've noticed the more clever tribespeople using chain bolas to capture them while airborne.\nDomesticated\nOnce tamed, Tropeognathus has proven quite useful to the people of the Isles beyond mere transportation. For example, its toothed beak can grind down many common goods to their base components, which is a great way to recycle items and gear! Well, so long as you have a rag handy to wipe off the spit... That bite is punishing enough to crack armor and grind through it over time, and Tropeognathus can blow away flora and fauna alike with a gust from its wings. Air-to-air combat is where this creature really shines, though. And with the right tools, some survivors have managed to fit them with a saddle-mounted flak cannon and jet engine for maximum lethality. Trust me, you haven't lived until you've ridden a jet-powered pterosaur into a dogfight. Saddle one up and see for yourself - you can be my wingman anytime!\n„\n~ Helena",

It resembles a gigantic horse/rhinoceros hybrid, but is over twice the size of either. Paraceratherium is a very peaceful and friendly creature. Barring some surprises yet in store for me, I can safely say that Paraceratherium is among the largest mammals on the Island. While its size means that Paraceratherium can provide an incredible amount of food, it also makes it dangerous when hunted.\nDomesticated\nA beast of burden second to the Brontosaurus, Paraceratherium is an excellent worker, and is sufficient in size to support a "platform" saddle upon which structures can be built. It is a naturally friendly animal, and is not afraid of humans. However, despite its normally calm demeanor, when it or its owner is provoked by aggression, the Paraceratherium can quickly become a real threat to the attacker and will use its girth to its advantage in combat.\n„\n~ Helena',

Pteranodon wyvernus's poor fighting and defensive skills mean they are likely to scavenge any number of dead animals rather than engage in dangerous combat with other creatures.

Because of this, they are one of the most common creatures to be found darting across the Island's skies.\nDomesticated\nPteranodons seem to be among most popular flying companions from what I have witnessed, possibly because they are relatively easy to tame with a slingshot or bow.

The creature is visually distinguished by its spectacular sail. In my travels I have seen many different and brightly coloured sails, as every Spinosaurus appears to have a slightly different palette. The one comforting fact about Spinosaurus is that it seems more at home near water than away from it.

Aside from size, the main difference between Draconis vipera and its larger cousin is that the former possesses only two legs, like an avian. Otherwise, it is quite similar, with armored scales, leathery wings and the ability to spew projectiles from a pair of glands inside its mouth. The nature of these projectiles is tied directly to the color of Draconis' scales. Some spit fire while others unleash poisonous acid or even bursts of bioelectricity.\nDomesticated\nI can imagine no flying mount more deadly than Draconis vipera. Its strength, toughness and ability rain death upon one's enemies makes it unmatched in combat. The few creatures that it cannot immediately overpower, it can outmaneuver. The ridges on its back form a natural saddle, to the point where many riders prefer to ride Draconis bareback. Curious indeed. However, Draconis vipera is too resilient to domesticate once it has become an adult. It must be raised from an egg if you wish to garner its loyalty.\n„\n~ Helena",

Their stature, gait and ability to dive through the air are all similar. However, where Draconis obscurum scaled cavern walls to gain the high ground, Draconis auragelus takes a more bombastic approach.\n\nIn the middle of its hind feet, Draconis auragelus\' bones form a hollowed out cylindrical shape that acts as a combustion chamber, which it fills with an explosive gas. When ignited, this gas propels it upwards, letting it "jump" in the air multiple times. From there, it can create a smaller burn in said chambers to hover in place, or dive at its prey.\n\nLike the icy variant of Draconis vipera, Draconis auragelus can slow down its foes with its frigid breath - though it\'s able to take this one step further and freeze its prey solid. Perhaps that\'s because it\'s used to living in the tundra environment on the surface, as opposed to a desert.\nDomesticated\nAs a mount, Draconis auragelus can carry multiple adult humans without losing any of its impressive mobility, and its freezing breath makes it a good choice in combat.

Since it never strays from the patch of frozen tundra we encountered, I believe the Obelisk was the key to its survival.\n\nClearly a descendant of modern Strigdae, Bubo shares many traits with its smaller ancestors. For example, it excretes waste in the form of pellets, which make excellent fertilizer, and their large wings let them save energy during long, silent flights. They even hunt in the same way: by diving towards the ground to attack their prey with powerful talons.\n\nHowever, these talons also secrete a chemical with a high freezing point to slow down their prey, and they can even unleash this chemical in a wide cloud, temporarily freezing their foes.\nDomesticated\nWith its swift flying and frigid attacks, Bubo makes an excellent single-rider support mount or scout.

However, when those fins are spread wide, Velonasaurus can rapidly fire a storm of spines at its prey. However, while in this state, its mobility is greatly hampered and it will eventually wear itself out.\n\nTherefore it sometimes prefers to unleash its spines in a single, deadly burst.

Normally a very docile grazing animal, Triceratops becomes aggressive once angered. Triceratops will chase down would-be predators (and egg-stealers) with incredible prejudice. Running away from triceratops is harder than it seems due to its ability to charge and ram its target. I've seen Triceratops have an especially hostile reaction to the Tyrannosaurus, with herds attacking en masse. While not very fast, they are deadly in a group.\nDomesticated\nA common mount for those that ride dinosaurs, Triceratops doubles as pack animal and combat dinosaur. Triceratops' bony ridge works excellently as cover from frontal attack, and the dinosaur's charge is incredibly dangerous. It is largely protective of its kinds if its sense danger. In the presence of larger carnivores that appears as a threat, Triceratops becomes stronger and rallies the effort of its nearby species. It is also capable of harvesting a sizable amount of resources with its horns by shredding fruit from the leaves, making it a very useful work companion for smaller tribes.\n„\n~ Helena",

Getting cornered or run down by a Giganotosaurus can mean certain death for nearly any creature! Fighting a Giganotosaurus directly is never a good idea, as its rage rapidly grows with every hit it takes. With this rage, it builds increasing reserves of energy to use, making its iron-jawed bites progressively more deadly and enhancing its stamina. Add to this the fact that its huge body also enables it to take a tremendous amount of punishment, and you have a creature that is generally better avoided or outsmarted than attacked head-on.\nDomesticated\nTaming Giganotosaurus is a dangerous prospect. Its rage reaction, even when tamed, can sometimes cause it to briefly turn on members of its own tribe. Indeed it may even throw off its rider if it has been sufficiently angered! And yet, the sheer size and immense power that the Giganotosaurus possesses means that some factions endeavor to tame it as a fear-inducing “Capital” beast of war, even at great risk!\n„\n~ Helena',

It is not able to intimidate every foe with its roar, but upon hearing it, it might scare the poop out of you - quite literally. Despite being a different sub-species of Tyrannosaurus, everyone I\'ve met still refers to them as a "Rex" or a "T-Rex". I\'ve long since stopped trying to convince anyone, especially the few who I\'ve encountered wearing Tyrannosaurus teeth as necklaces.\nDomesticated\nTaming a Tyrannosaurus is without a doubt the goal for any warlord or warring tribe.

While most aggressive theropods are relatively solitary creatures, Allosaurus lives in groups of 3. One Allosaurus is the alpha, while the others are its mates or a beta male. Like humans find value in forming a tribe, the Allosaurus has evolved to hunt in packs. Its saw-shaped teeth leave its prey bleeding and maimed, making escape difficult. Once an Allosaurus slows a creature with its cutting bite, the rest of its pack quickly closes in for the kill.\nDomesticated\nNot everyone thinks a tamed Allosaurus is ideal. Those who appreciate speed generally tame Carnotaurus, while those who value raw stopping power tame Tyrannosaurus. However, riders of Allosaurus tend to respect the utility of its Alpha pack status, which along with its bleed-inducing attacks and relative mobility, can effectively turn the tide of a combined arms battle.\n„\n~ Helena",

It tends to travel in small hunting packs, attacking smaller prey with its sharp teeth and enlarged foreclaws. When hunting in packs, the pack leader can vocalize a signal that acts as a battle cry. Be prepared to run or fight if you hear the call of the Utahraptor! The pack will repeat the calls and attack with much greater intensity. One of the faster creatures on the island, Utahraptor often uses their pack numbers to their advantage by swarming around their prey before it can react. The large curved talon on the second toe of this sub-species seems particularly suited for dealing significant damage. Utahraptor prime usually kill its prey with numerous slashing and biting attacks in rapid sequence.\nDomesticated\nWhat the Utahraptor lacks in size, it makes up for in ingenuity. Rather than chase down smaller creatures, Utahraptor will pounce and pin its prey to the ground rather than chasing it around. Despite its normally aggressive nature, Utahraptors have become one of the primary combat mounts for roaming bands of raiders, as well as scouts for larger collectives. Those who ride Utahraptor claim they are difficult to tame, but then fiercely loyal. As a carnivore, once tamed they require a steady stream of meat to sustain.\n„\n~ Helena',

Fortunately, Colossus petram's massive size makes it quite slow, so I would advise most survivors to flee immediately if encountering it in the wild. Colossus petram survives by slowly absorbing nearby minerals while in its dormant state, which consequently means that its body contains a wealth of metal ingots.

The creature is visually distinguished by its spectacular sail. In my travels I have seen many different and brightly coloured sails, as every Spinosaurus appears to have a slightly different palette. The one comforting fact about Spinosaurus is that it seems more at home near water than away from it. Although the creature is more powerful, faster, agile, and insatiable while in water, it tends to become less hostile as it gets farther from it. On one occasion, I only escaped a Spinosaurus by getting far enough from its lake home to make it simply lose interest.\nDomesticated\nSpinosaurus is an incredibly well-rounded apex carnivore. Faster than a Tyrannosaurus in water and able to travel on land unlike a Megalodon, its all-terrain versatility may be unrivaled.

Like all Parasaur, it has a signature crest on its head. Very docile at first, I've been able to approach the creature without disturbing it. If startled, however, the creature can vocalize a distress call to the surrounding area that warns of danger. Parasaurolophus appears to be low on the food chain and is hunted by everything, creatures and humans alike, which explains its skittish nature. It is a good source of meat and hide, if you can manage to keep up with it long enough to kill it.\nDomesticated\nDespite being what most tribes consider a relatively useless creature to tame, I once met an interesting woman who had tamed an entire herd of them. She informed me that many overlooked the creature's potential. She even graciously gifted me a fancy saddle to put on my own Parasaurolophus one day. As a relatively simple creature to domesticate, Parasaurolophus is commonly one of the first mounts a tribe will be able to acquire. Its ability to run relatively fast for lengthy intervals makes it a solid mode of medium-range transportation, though it has almost no ability to defend itself or its rider in a traditional sense. Smaller creatures, however, appear to be frightened by the horn of Parasaurolophus although it doesn't do much damage. It also has decent weight-bearing capabilities, which could prove useful for nomadic tribes as they work to establish a presence on the Island.\n„\n~ Helena",

I find it strange that such a large, imposing beast would be so skittish. Unlike other creatures of its size, it is more likely to flee than fight.

Be prepared to run or fight if you hear the call of the Utahraptor! The pack will repeat the calls and attack with much greater intensity. One of the faster creatures on the island, Utahraptor often uses their pack numbers to their advantage by swarming around their prey before it can react.

And once you saddle one up, not even an Argentavis could knock you off that perch.

These various plate configurations also come in handy for stripping wood from trees, gathering thatch, or foraging for wild berries, respectively. Stegosaurus can knock back or impale with a whip of its spiky tail, keeping predators at bay or pinning them in place. Its spiked appendage also helps for gathering berries—go figure.\n„\n~ Helena",

Once an Allosaurus slows a creature with its cutting bite, the rest of its pack quickly closes in for the kill.\nDomesticated\nNot everyone thinks a tamed Allosaurus is ideal. Those who appreciate speed generally tame Carnotaurus, while those who value raw stopping power tame Tyrannosaurus. However, riders of Allosaurus tend to respect the utility of its Alpha pack status, which along with its bleed-inducing attacks and relative mobility, can effectively turn the tide of a combined arms battle.\n„\n~ Helena",

I believe they can afford to stick with smaller groups because of their incredibly thick skin, for which they're named. Despite not being among the largest of the Island's herbivores, Ankylosaurus is one of the more difficult creatures to take down. Its thick, armored skin seems to make it more than a match for several of the mid-sized predators that would otherwise hunt it. Reckless carnivores are just as likely to hurt themselves on Ankylosaurus' spikes, as they are to get hit by its tail.\nDomesticated\nWithout a doubt, the best trait of a trained Ankylosaurus is its enormously dense tail.

The Island's mountains are the perfect habitat, as the mammal's fur keeps it safe from the bitter temperature. While its huge fangs are excellent for delivering deathblows, the creature's claws can be just as deadly. Despite normally being a solitary creature, Smilodon brutalis are not opposed to hunting in small packs. In fact, they have to do this to take down larger prey such as Mammoths. Enough Sabertooths can take down a Carnotaurus, perhaps even a Tyrannosaurus. Either way, Smilodon brutalis should not be underestimated.\nDomesticated\nWhile not as fast as Raptors, there's no denying the Sabertooth's increased resilience and power. In addition, well-trained Sabertooth can be taught to use their claws to flay corpses. This may sound morbid, but it is among the best ways to quickly gather large quantities of hide from the giant beasts of the Island.\n„\n~ Helena",

Its main form of protection is swimming in a large school. Oncorhynchus does not like conflict, and generally swims away from anything larger than itself at very high speeds. Once provoked, however, Oncorhynchus becomes quite aggressive, along with its nearby brethren. It locks onto its prey with its long "saberteeth" and begins draining that creature\'s blood. This loss of blood is not too dangerous alone, but when a school of Oncorhynchus attack at once, their target quickly loses speed and stamina from blood loss, drowning if it cannot breath underwater.\nDomesticated\nLike many of the smaller fish found on or around the Island, Oncorhynchus cannot be tamed, but it is often herded and harvested for its resources. In particular, certain cuts of Oncorhynchus meat are considered to have superb quality, and are often referred to as "Prime Fish" used for specific high-end concoctions and taming the Island\'s many piscivorous creatures.\n„\n~ Helena',

Spinosaurus' four legs and large sail make it fairly swift on land and incredibly fast in the water. Its marvel is, arguably, the ability to change stances by going from quadruped to biped. The creature is visually distinguished by its spectacular sail. In my travels I have seen many different and brightly coloured sails, as every Spinosaurus appears to have a slightly different palette. The one comforting fact about Spinosaurus is that it seems more at home near water than away from it. Although the creature is more powerful, faster, agile, and insatiable while in water, it tends to become less hostile as it gets farther from it. On one occasion, I only escaped a Spinosaurus by getting far enough from its lake home to make it simply lose interest.\nDomesticated\nSpinosaurus is an incredibly well-rounded apex carnivore. Faster than a Tyrannosaurus in water and able to travel on land unlike a Megalodon, its all-terrain versatility may be unrivaled. Although its movement speed is slower in a biped stance, it gains considerable attacking strength and mobility in this form. For hunters who wish to have a well-rounded mount, Spinosaurus may be the ideal choice -- if they can acquire one.\n„\n~ Helena",

Initially, I'd thought the fin was simply composed of keratin, but closer inspection has led me to believe that it is actually some kind of sensory organ. Not only does it decrease Tapejara's turning radius even at high speeds, but it apparently provides Tapejara with extra information to help it fly through the air with unparalleled grace. I've even seen Tapejara hover and strafe side-to-side in the air without moving forward at all. It's quite remarkable. The creature also makes effective use of razor-sharp claws to latch onto surfaces such as the trunks of tall trees, holding its position indefinitely.\nDomesticated\nWarlike tribes appear to consider Tapejara the equivalent of a versatile rotor aircraft, capable of rapid positional changes and aggressive agility. When domesticated the Tapejara is typically outfitted with a unique triple-rider saddle, enabling two passengers to wield handheld weaponry while the pilot takes the reins.

It stands at just over half the size of known Dilophosaurs and runs from aggressors as often as it fights them. Dilophosaurus sputatrix has a few traits not common in the Dilophosaurus genus. It has a very shrill call, and a decorative ridge of skin on its neck. I believe these are used to attract mates, as well as intimidate prey and would-be predators. Instead of attacking its prey outright, Dilophosaurus sputatrix spits venom to weaken and paralyze it before moving in for the kill.\nDomesticated\nBecause of their shrill cry and their ability to attack intruders from range, Dilophosaurus seem most suited as "guard dogs."

The Direbear ignores most non-hostile creatures while going about its daily routine of scavenging for meat and edible plant life... ...that is, until intruders enter the territory it considers its own, at which point the creature ferociously attacks. Most often, it is smartest to just run from an angry Direbear.\nDomesticated\nOnce tamed, the Direbear is a strong and reliable mount. It can carry vast quantities of goods, and can sprint for extremely long, nearly infinite periods. It is not the fastest creature from a hard stop, but after building up momentum, its sustained overland speed builds to among the best of the island. Of course, being able to feed a direbear both meat and plant life makes keeping one fairly convenient regardless of the environment.

In Equus, survivors will find a trusty steed or pack animal that can carry them swiftly across land. Taming an Equus has proven interesting, requiring carefully approaching the creature in the wild, mounting it, and then carefully soothing over time by feeding it vegetables. In fact, Equus' reliability has lead some survivors to construct special saddles for them. I even encountered a man who added extra saddle-pouches that doubled as mobile crafting stations for chemical supplies, foodstuffs, and other items. Although not as robust as what you might find within a village, this utility helped him live a nomadic, solitary lifestyle. Some survivors employ Equus to herd and wrangle other creatures with a specialized lasso. This tool is sometimes effective for self-defense as well, as Equus is limited in battle on its own...at least compared to aggressive prehistoric carnivores.\n„\n~ Helena",

Its long claws and semi-opposable digits make it an apt climber, a quality that Thylacoleo uses to its advantage while hunting. It clambers up large trees and waits to ambush passing prey by pouncing upon them. When something that large jumps onto a target, the victim becomes stunned and doesn't stand much of a chance. Thylacoleo's most notable fighting quality is its powerful jaws. Once it bites its prey, it locks its jaw in an iron grip that can hold most smaller creatures in place. Thylacoleo then goes on to savage its prey with its sharp claws. If it needs to escape from a fight, Thylacoleo uses its muscular hind legs to jump back to safety among the trees.\nDomesticated\nThylacoleo is a moderately strong mount, and its ability to climb trees and jump long distances makes it useful for traversal. As such, developing tribes often tame it. Small raiding parties particularly favor Thylacoleo, as it is well suited to ambushes and unfair fights!\n„\n~ Helena",

With its slow walking speed, the only things that keep it safe are its surprisingly fast swim speed, and its incredibly thick shell, which can absorb tremendous damage.\nDomesticated\nCarbonemys' swift swim rate, fairly high strength, superior shell defenses, and lack of real threat makes it an ideal armored mount for many survivors who shy away from violence.

Like humans find value in forming a tribe, the Allosaurus has evolved to hunt in packs. Its saw-shaped teeth leave its prey bleeding and maimed, making escape difficult.

Those who appreciate speed generally tame Carnotaurus, while those who value raw stopping power tame Tyrannosaurus.

Its meat is also extremely succulent, a surprise given its size. It is often traded with the same value as Prime Meat, and colloquially called 'Prime Fish'. Of course, not all of Leedsichthys' meat is this high quality, but most of it is! While the demand for Leedsichthys meat is high, the fish is notoriously difficult to track and hunt. Between its large size, powerful attacks, incredible speed (when it turns to flee), and humankind's general ineptitude on open water, actually killing a Leedsichthys is one of the Island's more difficult tasks. The hunt for an extremely elusive breed of the fish, the fabled 'Great Albino' Leedsichthys has been known to drive otherwise-sensible men and women mad with obsession, as if all evil were visibly personified and made practically assailable in this one creature.\nDomesticated\nDespite its large size, and the fact that it may well be strong enough to carry heavy loads, Leedsichthys does not appear to be intelligent enough to tame. Nevertheless, some large tribes keep an enormous pen with a few Leedsichthys trapped inside for cultivating purposes, as bits of Prime Fish can be repeatedly scraped off the gargantuan beast without killing it!\n„\n~ Helena",

Approximately 30 feet long, Tusoteuthis is a terror of the deep.

Firstly, its grab slowly renders its victim unconscious, so death isn't the only concern. Secondly, its vampiric blood drain instantly revitalizes it, even during combat.

It\'s a powerful swimmer which has adapted to the shallows so remarkably well that it rapidly recovers from injuries when near the water\'s surface. Conversely, it\'s vulnerable to deep water pressure, which slowly causes it harm. Basilosaurus is usually closely followed by other predatory creatures, as its eating habits leave plenty of scraps for scavengers to consume. It is a gentle creature towards humans and happily laps up food directly from them. However, the creatures that trail the "Basi" tend to become dangerously enraged whenever this occurs, as it leaves no leftovers for them.\nDomesticated\nDespite the hassle of engaging with its ornery followers, many tribes still attempt to tame the Basilosaurus, as its mammalian, warm-blooded circulation provides a rider with perfect comfort from both heat and cold. Being apprehensive in nature, Basilosaurus is equipped with a defense mechanism that prevents it from being stunned or shocked. Alternatively, Basilosaurus is hunted (perhaps too vigorously) for its special blubber, which can be efficiently refined into gasoline!\n„\n~ Helena',

Because it lives off smaller prey than humans, it generally ignores anything much larger than a Coelacanth. Dimetrodon is one of the few carnivores on the Island that could be classified as reasonably friendly in the wild. The sail on Dimetrodon's back is an especially fascinating thing. It can be angled to provide shade from the sun and allows Dimetrodon to disperse heat more quickly. The inner workings of the sail can also restrict blood flow in the creature to hold in excessive heat. Together, these two traits allow Dimetrodon to comfortably survive in any climate, though they are most commonly found in the swamplands which are rich in prey.\nDomesticated\nIf Dimetrodon was a bit larger, or didn't have that massive sail, it would make a decent mount. However, its main use to survivors is to utilize the sail's insulating capabilities. Just being near Dimetrodon gives excellent protection from both heat and cold, which has saved my life through more than one ice blizzard in the frozen northlands.\n„\n~ Helena",

Despite its common name, it is actually a very long Knifefish, and not an Eel. It does not provide much meat, so many predators simply leave it be. Unlike most predators, it does not use brute strength to bring down its prey, but instead releases an electrical charge around itself to knock its prey unconscious. Alone, this can take out a small creature. When attacking together, Electrophorus can even bring down the larger ocean lifeforms, and then feed as a group.\nDomesticated\nBy far, the most common use of Electrophorus is to subdue large ocean creatures. Knocking out a Plesiosaur or other giant deep-sea leviathan can be incredibly difficult... ...thus many tribes employ small schools of Electrophorus to shock them into submission!\n„\n~ Helena',

Based on its stripes, it may be the African variant of Equus giganteus, which appeared in North America during the Ice Age, but that is pure conjecture. Its behavior in the wild is similar to that of other wild members of the Equus genus - it sustains itself by grazing, while keeping safe from predators by living in herds and outrunning its attackers via superior speed and stamina.\nDomesticated\nHorse and man have long been partners in survival, and this remains true on the Island. In Equus, survivors will find a trusty steed or pack animal that can carry them swiftly across land. Taming an Equus has proven interesting, requiring carefully approaching the creature in the wild, mounting it, and then carefully soothing over time by feeding it vegetables. In fact, Equus' reliability has lead some survivors to construct special saddles for them. I even encountered a man who added extra saddle-pouches that doubled as mobile crafting stations for chemical supplies, foodstuffs, and other items. Although not as robust as what you might find within a village, this utility helped him live a nomadic, solitary lifestyle. Some survivors employ Equus to herd and wrangle other creatures with a specialized lasso. This tool is sometimes effective for self-defense as well, as Equus is limited in battle on its own...at least compared to aggressive prehistoric carnivores.\n„\n~ Helena",

This has caused many tribes to hunt Kairuku extensively, a practice colloquially known as "Kairu Clubbing."\nDomesticated\nThere is no reason to tame Kairuku for combat, since they are useless at it. Still, Kairuku are regularly tamed for their cuteness and friendly nature, and the fact that their bodies run extremely hot. Just standing near Kairuku can help keep a survivor stay warm through long, harsh nights on the icebergs.\n„\n~ Helena',

A naturally fast runner that is even faster in the water, it is a solitary hunter that picks off small-to-medium creatures, especially those isolated from their pack. When attacking, Kaprosuchus uses two main tactics. First, it patiently waits below the water surface and when the target is sufficiently close by, will perform a lateral jump that it uses to quickly close distance with its prey and drag it underwater. Secondly, its attacks the prey's vital areas specifically to drain its stamina. These two techniques effectively prevent most creatures from escaping Kaprosuchus once an assault has begun.\nDomesticated\nSurvivors are generally split about the usefulness of Kaprosuchus. Some love its speed both in and out of the water, essentially making it among the fastest small-sized, all-terrain mounts when travelling through the wetlands.

Actually, it is a type of griffinfly, an extinct species of invertebrate that looked similar to dragonflies. Like most griffinflies, Meganeura is carnivorous, but it is typically not aggressive towards humans unless provoked or challenged for food. It lives primarily in the wetter, heavily wooded areas, such as the jungles. Meganeura is a natural predator of most of the smaller insects on the island. Though not often aggressive, Meganeura will not turn down a free meal. They quickly appear in large numbers to scavenge off the victims of Pulmonoscorpius, rendered unconscious and unable to defend themselves. Of course the insects do have to avoid the Pulmonoscorpius itself. I have noticed it is unwise to disturb a flock of feeding Meganeura.\nDomesticated\nThe size of the insects on the island confounds me. The way these creatures diffuse oxygen should limit their size but Meganeura (and other bugs) seem to be able to advance beyond this restraint. If there is more oxygen in the air this could explain Meganeura's growth.\n„\n~ Helena",

If startled, however, the creature can vocalize a distress call to the surrounding area that warns of danger. Parasaurolophus appears to be low on the food chain and is hunted by everything, creatures and humans alike, which explains its skittish nature. It is a good source of meat and hide, if you can manage to keep up with it long enough to kill it.\nDomesticated\nDespite being what most tribes consider a relatively useless creature to tame, I once met an interesting woman who had tamed an entire herd of them. She informed me that many overlooked the creature's potential. She even graciously gifted me a fancy saddle to put on my own Parasaurolophus one day. As a relatively simple creature to domesticate, Parasaurolophus is commonly one of the first mounts a tribe will be able to acquire. Its ability to run relatively fast for lengthy intervals makes it a solid mode of medium-range transportation, though it has almost no ability to defend itself or its rider in a traditional sense. Smaller creatures, however, appear to be frightened by the horn of Parasaurolophus although it doesn't do much damage. It also has decent weight-bearing capabilities, which could prove useful for nomadic tribes as they work to establish a presence on the Island.\n„\n~ Helena",

It is content to spend all day alone, gorging itself on far more food than you might reasonably expect for a creature of its tiny stature. Its beak appears perfectly evolved for collecting food from plants while avoiding the indigestible fibrous strands. Pegomastax is likely to ignore any nearby creature and continue foraging, unless it is attacked. At which point, it turns into a very aggressive (though rather unthreatening) opponent, shrieking and wooping far above its actual threat level. You would expect a creature this small and weak to live in flocks, but Pegomastax seems to be fairly solitary in nature.\nDomesticated\nWhile not pretty, and far too small to ride, tribes often keep Pegomastax around as a kind of farming aid.

However, it seems to spend far more time hunting for fish over the open deep-sea. In fact, I have rarely spotted a wild Pelagornis anywhere near the coasts of the main Island, as it prefers to rest its wings by paddling on the ocean's surface rather than waddling along the Island's beaches. Perhaps this behavior is a result of its survival instincts. The Early Miocene was a post-dinosaur epoch, after all, and Pelagornis would not be accustomed to such predators. Considering how quickly it flees from humans, one can hardly blame its caution.\nDomesticated\nBecause of its ability to fly, walk and surface-swim, a tamed Pelagornis is one of the Island's most versatile mounts, but this comes at a cost.

Either way, Smilodon brutalis should not be underestimated.\nDomesticated\nWhile not as fast as Raptors, there's no denying the Sabertooth's increased resilience and power. In addition, well-trained Sabertooth can be taught to use their claws to flay corpses. This may sound morbid, but it is among the best ways to quickly gather large quantities of hide from the giant beasts of the Island.\n„\n~ Helena",

Its main form of protection is swimming in a large school. Oncorhynchus does not like conflict, and generally swims away from anything larger than itself at very high speeds. Once provoked, however, Oncorhynchus becomes quite aggressive, along with its nearby brethren. It locks onto its prey with its long "saberteeth" and begins draining that creature\'s blood. This loss of blood is not too dangerous alone, but when a school of Oncorhynchus attack at once, their target quickly loses speed and stamina from blood loss, drowning if it cannot breath underwater.\nDomesticated\nLike many of the smaller fish found on or around the Island, Oncorhynchus cannot be tamed, but it is often herded and harvested for its resources. In particular, certain cuts of Oncorhynchus meat are considered to have superb quality, and are often referred to as "Prime Fish" used for specific high-end concoctions and taming the Island\'s many piscivorous creatures.\n„\n~ Helena',

A good tactic for escaping many predators is to jump into the water, as most are slow swimmers.

Spinosaurus' four legs and large sail make it fairly swift on land and incredibly fast in the water. Its marvel is, arguably, the ability to change stances by going from quadruped to biped. The creature is visually distinguished by its spectacular sail. In my travels I have seen many different and brightly coloured sails, as every Spinosaurus appears to have a slightly different palette. The one comforting fact about Spinosaurus is that it seems more at home near water than away from it. Although the creature is more powerful, faster, agile, and insatiable while in water, it tends to become less hostile as it gets farther from it. On one occasion, I only escaped a Spinosaurus by getting far enough from its lake home to make it simply lose interest.\nDomesticated\nSpinosaurus is an incredibly well-rounded apex carnivore. Faster than a Tyrannosaurus in water and able to travel on land unlike a Megalodon, its all-terrain versatility may be unrivaled. Although its movement speed is slower in a biped stance, it gains considerable attacking strength and mobility in this form. For hunters who wish to have a well-rounded mount, Spinosaurus may be the ideal choice -- if they can acquire one.\n„\n~ Helena",

And once you saddle one up, not even an Argentavis could knock you off that perch. A stegosaurus can be trained to flex its back plates for different purposes: hardened to shield it from attack, in a heavier alignment that deals crippling blows, or oriented more sharply to pierce armor. These various plate configurations also come in handy for stripping wood from trees, gathering thatch, or foraging for wild berries, respectively.

Initially, I'd thought the fin was simply composed of keratin, but closer inspection has led me to believe that it is actually some kind of sensory organ. Not only does it decrease Tapejara's turning radius even at high speeds, but it apparently provides Tapejara with extra information to help it fly through the air with unparalleled grace. I've even seen Tapejara hover and strafe side-to-side in the air without moving forward at all. It's quite remarkable.

This is contrary to the alternating rows on Stegosaurus fossils I've seen in museums. Not surprisingly, Stegosaurus uses the spines on its tail to defend itself. While not aggressive, Stegosaurus will come to the aid of another nearby Stegosaurus. This implies it to be a herd animal.\nDomesticated\nStegosaurus is commonly used as a safe way to transport large quantities of goods. And once you saddle one up, not even an Argentavis could knock you off that perch. A stegosaurus can be trained to flex its back plates for different purposes: hardened to shield it from attack, in a heavier alignment that deals crippling blows, or oriented more sharply to pierce armor. These various plate configurations also come in handy for stripping wood from trees, gathering thatch, or foraging for wild berries, respectively. Stegosaurus can knock back or impale with a whip of its spiky tail, keeping predators at bay or pinning them in place. Its spiked appendage also helps for gathering berries—go figure.\n„\n~ Helena",

It is a large and dangerous creature, though it seems fairly trusting of the fauna around it. Once attacked, Coelodonta begins charging towards its foe. It builds up momentum as it charges, and depending on its ultimate impact speed, the results can be terrifying. With enough room to charge, it can even skewer the largest creatures in just one gore! Despite how powerful Coelodonta are, many tribes still hunt them extensively due to their unique resources. Its horns can ground into a highly arousing powder, and its thick fur can support many insulating outfits, making the Coelodonta in high demand. Even less-advanced tribes use packs to hunt them down, though at significant peril.\nDomesticated\nWhen not being hunted for its horns, Coelodonta makes an impressive beast of burden. Its ability to take on far larger opponents provided sufficient charging room, as well as its sizeable load capacity, make it a solid addition to any trader party or gathering expedition.\n„\n~ Helena',

Feathered creatures are not necessarily viewed as dangerous predators in the same light as other theropods. However, the Yutyrannus strikes fear into even the Island\'s most skilled hunters. There are few wild predators that are able to pack-hunt alongside the generally hostile Carnotaurus, like the Yutyrannus does, with such ease. It is also the only creature I\'ve seen to consistently induce a state of panic in opponents with its roar. Upon hearing it, most creatures in the area will flee for safety.\nDomesticated\nA domesticated Yutyrannus can be a powerful offensive or defensive addition to war parties. With its mighty roar, it can induce fear in opposing creatures. Meanwhile, Yutyrannus can be trained to develop a confidence-boosting Battle-Cry which counteracts enemy attempts to induce fear, while also bolstering the resolve of allies, and may even draw wild Carnotaurus to its aid. These unique "leadership" qualities make the Yutyrannus a versatile, and at times, a necessary creature to have on your side during large-scale confrontations!\n„\n~ Helena',

Many ancient myths tell of various depictions of the Griffin over the ages, but what is never disputed is its majestic and mysterious nature. With the front half of an eagle and the back half of a lion, it is as if these two creatures somehow fused together to form a superior land and air predator. While one's first instinct might be to approach the creature and marvel at its beauty, that would be a very poor decision. Its range of attacks makes it one of the more versatile predators I've witnessed. If its presence alone isn't enough to intimidate potential hunters, it has the ability to dive from the sky to the ground with such force that it inflicts damage to anyone unfortunate enough to be below it, or carry its momentum back into a rapid uplift.\nDomesticated\nThe idea of pacifying such a beast is nothing to scoff at. Its highly independent nature and disinterest with interacting with humans combined with its power and strength make the Griffin a challenge to domesticate. However, there have been those who are fearless enough to attempt and succeed at this miraculous feat. Once tamed, riding atop a Griffin along with a tribemate passenger, dashing through the air at high speed, is a prize in and of itself.\n„\n~ Helena",

Given the desolate nature of the region, that makes its options rather limited, but fortunately its relationship with the desert's plants is symbiotic. In addition to pollinating them, the spores it releases help nourish the harsh desert plants. When attacked, the slow-moving Lymantria immediately takes to the air and flies almost straight up while releasing spores. While the spores are nutritious to most plants, they are highly poisonous to most other organisms.\nDomesticated\nLymantria is occasionally used as a one man flying mount, but its ability to produce silk and spores is often considered more valuable due to its slow flight speed. Its silk can be weaved into heat-dispersing cloth, and its spores gathered for fertilizer or poison. Its saving grace as a mount is its ability to release spores mid flight, allowing it to act as a primitive bomber during sieges.\n„\n~ Helena",

I have even found clear patterns in the sounds Empusa makes when communicating with its own kind, as though it is actually using some kind of dialect. I would love to study these interactions in depth, but observing Empusa up close is extremely dangerous. Its size, intelligence and ability to pounce on its prey from a great distance mean that one could be quickly swarmed and killed upon detection. Caution is recommended.\nDomesticated\nThough a dangerous task, successfully taming Empusa can prove highly beneficial. Its unique claws allow it to wield melee weapons like spears or pikes in battle, and use tools while harvesting resources.

The ridges on its back form a natural saddle, to the point where many riders prefer to ride Draconis bareback. Curious indeed. However, Draconis vipera is too resilient to domesticate once it has become an adult. It must be raised from an egg if you wish to garner its loyalty.\n„\n~ Helena",

Superior hunters, they leap from a hiding place and pounce on their prey. The Deinonychus is an agile climber as well, jumping from wall ledge to wall ledge as it seeks high vantage points to lie in wait. A hungry Deinonychus tends to be fearless and will hunt prey much larger than itself, latching onto a dinosaur's back with its sickle-shaped claws, then starting to feed before its victim is even dead. While it likes its meat fresh, a Deinonychus isn't above scavenging a carcass if no other food is available.\nDomesticated\nRaising a Deinonychus in captivity requires an ample food supply, as they have a fast metabolism to match their high activity level. The Deinonychus is also fiercely territorial near nests with eggs, even if the eggs aren't its own. This makes breeding successive generations a hazardous process. Unless raised from eggs, they cannot be tamed; the hunter instinct of a wild Deinonychus is so strong that it reflexively pounces on a would-be master.\n„\n~ Helena",
