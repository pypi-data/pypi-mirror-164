    """
    Get a DataFrame where all data points have the same step between the values in column given by `key`
    NOTE: this function is rather unstable, as it has a few dirty assumptions, such as:
    - steps are modulo stepsize. Breaks e.g. with steps start with 1 and go up by stepSize.
    - ideal step-size is max step difference. Breaks e.g. if there is one big gap

    Arguments:
        - data: the DataFrame to unify the step-size for
        - key: the column name indicating the column containing the step-nr.
        - maxExpectedStepSize: use to get a warning if the computed step-size is larger

    Returns:
        - data: a DataFrame with a consistent step-size
