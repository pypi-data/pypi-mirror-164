# Ky3M

Minecraft Mod Manager by Leon "Procybit" Shepelev

## Installing

Via pip:

```
pip install ky3m
```

You can also update to the latest version:

```
pip install ky3m --upgrade
```

**Make sure you have Python 3.10 or above installed!**

## Program launch

Via terminal:

```
python -m ky3m
```

## Using the CLI

If the program is run correctly, this should be in the terminal:
```
Ky3M :>
```
At the moment, the only thing that can be entered into the CLI is methods.

Methods are simple commands that work directly with Ky3M internals.

The name of the method is written in CAPITAL LETTERS, the specification fields of the method are written with spaces:

```
Ky3M :> METHOD Field_1 Field_2 ANoTheR--fiEld00;[-+^ 4thFIELD
Something happened...
```

If the method name starts with the "adv" prefix, then the associated log will be displayed:

```
Ky3M :> advMETHOD Field_1 Field_2 ANoTheR--fiEld00;[-+^ 4thFIELD
Something happened...

Log intercepted!
[ky3m.methods] METHOD started!
[ky3m.something] Something happened! (something: True)
[ky3m.methods] METHOD ended!
```
