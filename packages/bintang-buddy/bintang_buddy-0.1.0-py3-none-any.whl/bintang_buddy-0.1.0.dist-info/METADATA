# Command line tool

## Installation
```
pip install bintang-buddy
```

## Usage
The steps are straightforward and very human.

Try running the commands below:
```
bintang-buddy -d "2022-01-13" -g "milpitas" -g "sunnyvale"
```

This script has two arguments:
1. `-d`: Date string, in the form of `YYYY-MM-DD`
2. `-g`: The names of the gyms you'd like to load court schedules for. If you leave this empty you'll get every court for every gym, and you'll be waiting for a while. Your choices: `campbell, dublin, milpitas, san carlos, sunnyvale`.
