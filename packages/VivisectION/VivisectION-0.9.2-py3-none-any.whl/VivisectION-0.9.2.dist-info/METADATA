# VivisectION Emulation-Driven Reversing Toolset

VivisectION is the cross-section of GUI Reversing, Emulation and Debugging, with an emphasis on using Emulation and other powerful Vivisect toys to aid in Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Research.

Among other things, VivisectION (aka Ion) is a Vivisect Extension (or plugin).

Primarily this plugin allows the GUI to easily setup an emulator for Functions (right click on the Function address)


## Installation:

Install Vivisect and make sure it works before installing VivisectION.  

On Ubuntu, install PyQt5 and PyQtWebkit via apt:
```
    $ sudo apt install python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5.qtwebkit
```

On other Linux, you may find either of these work.  On Ubuntu, PyPi's PyQt5 installation somehow breaks things.

On Windows (and possibly some Linuxes), be sure to include the [gui] option:
```
    $ pip install vivisect[gui]
```


Then install VivisectION using Pip:
```
    $ pip install VivisectION
```

Alternately, you can install from the latest Github repo (or using a modified form on your local drive):
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/atlas0fd00m/VivisectION
       #(possibly modify anything)
    $ pip install ./VivisectION
```


### You must first activate the plugin:
The following tools will manage a symlink to the plugin directory into $HOME/.viv/plugins/ (or the last directory in your VIV_EXT_PATH)
```
    $ vivisection_activate      # to install the plugin
        # and 
    $ vivisection_deactivate    # to remove the plugin
```

## Features:
* Ion Toolbar in Vivisect
* Function Emulation (console) - Right click on the using the console (how you started Vivisect)
* CLI - by clicking the button, users get an interactive python shell in the console (cli you started Vivisect from)


## Future:
* It will also glue debuggers together with Vivisect Server/Shared Workspace

* Debugger attach, dump, and prep for Emulation
    * Import VSNAP, convert to Emu
    * Import GDB Core file, convert to Emu

* Other goodies as I decide to release them (probably expect FuncRecon shortly)

## Getting Started

* "Activate" the plugin
* Start vivbin from a console (not an icon that hides the console)
* Click the CLI button to get an interactive python session in the console with `vw` as the VivWorkspace
* Right Click on a Function address and choose `SmartEmu - console` from the context menu.
** Modify (if desired) the emulator setup in the pop-up window
** Get a NinjaEmulator in the console window
** After you quit the NinjaEmulator, you'll get dropped into iPython.  Ctrl-D or exit to get out (before emulating anything else)


## FAQ:
* <xyz> happened and now my command line won't show me typing anything
** Type (blind, I know)  `stty sane` and press enter.  This normally sets the terminal back to normal (sane).


## Blessing

go forth and hack great things!
